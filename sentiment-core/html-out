<p>Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Charging 
 
</p>
<p>1. SCOPE 
</p>
<p>This standard and information handbook presents an overview of the current 
understanding of the various plasma interactions that can result when a high voltage 
system is operated in the Earth’s ionosphere, references common design practices that 
have exacerbated plasma interactions in the past, and recommends standard practices to 
eliminate or mitigate such reactions. 
</p>
<p>1.1 Purpose 
</p>
<p>The purpose of this standard is to provide a design standard for high-voltage space power 
systems (&gt;55 volts) that operate in the plasma environment associated with LEO (altitude 
from 200 and 1000 km and latitude between -50 and +50 degrees).  Such power systems, 
particularly solar arrays, are the proximate cause of spacecraft charging in LEO and these 
systems can interact with this environment in a number of ways that are potentially 
destructive to themselves as well as to the platform or vehicle that has deployed them. 
 
High voltage systems are used in space for two reasons.  The first reason is  to save 
launch weight.  First of all, for the same power level, higher voltages enable use of 
thinner wires (lighter cabling).  This is true because P = IV, and V = IR, so P = I2R 
(where P is power, I is current, R is resistance, and V is voltage).  If I is decreased by use 
of higher V, then thinner wires can be used with no increase in power loss due to cabling.  
Of course, if one uses the same cable mass, higher voltages will enable higher 
efficiencies, since less power will be lost to resistance in the cables.  For very large power 
systems, the decrease in cable mass can be substantial. 
 
Second, some spacecraft functions require high voltages.  For example, electric 
propulsion uses voltages from about 300 V (Hall thrusters) to about 1000 V (ion 
thrusters).  For low voltage power systems, conversion of substantial power to high 
voltages is required for these spacecraft functions to operate.  The weight of the power 
conversion systems, power management and distribution (PMAD), can be a substantial 
fraction of the total power system weight in these cases.  It is more efficient, and can save 
weight, if the high voltage functions can be directly powered from a high voltage solar 
array, for instance.  If the high voltage function is electric propulsion, we call such a 
system a direct-drive electric propulsion system.   
 
Because of these and other reasons for using high voltages in space, spacecraft designers 
and manufacturers are using high voltages more and more.  However, the use of high 
voltages entails risk; in particular, spacecraft charging in LEO, in contrast to that in 
geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), is caused by exposed high voltages, and can lead 
to arcing, power drains, power disruptions, and loss of spacecraft coatings.  Thus, system </p>

</p>

</p>
<p>designers need a standard to show them how to mitigate the spacecraft charging effects of 
using high voltages in LEO.  In addition to system designers, this document should be 
useful to project managers, solar array designers, system engineers, etc. 
 
This document is intended as a standard for design applications and can be used as a 
requirements specification instrument.  
</p>
<p>1.2 Applicability  
</p>
<p>This standard is applicable to high-voltage space power systems that operate in the plasma 
environment associated with LEO. 
   
This standard is intended for space systems that spend the majority of their time at 
altitudes between 200 and 1000 km (usually known as LEO applications) and at latitudes 
between about + and – 50 degrees — that is, space systems that do not encounter GEO 
(geosynchronous orbit) charging conditions, that do not (often) encounter the auroral 
ovals of electron streams, and that do not fly through the Van Allen belts.  For the 
extreme radiation protection that is necessary for orbits in the Van Allen belts, 
exterior spacecraft charging will likely be a secondary concern.  However, internal 
charging will be very important.  It is not in the purview of this document to deal with 
internal charging. 
 
Some of the design standards for LEO are at variance with good design practice for GEO 
spacecraft.  If your spacecraft will fly in both LEO and GEO conditions, be careful to use 
design solutions that are applicable in both environmental regimes. 
</p>
<p>This standard may be cited in contract, program, and other Agency documents as a 
technical requirement.  Mandatory requirements are indicated by the word “shall.”  
Tailoring of this standard for application to a specific program/project shall be approved 
by the Technical Authority for that program/project. </p>

<p>4. REQUIREMENTS  
</p>
<p>4.1 General LEO Standard Requirements 
 
4.1.1 Arcs on Spacecraft in LEO 
 
4.1.1.1   Arcs on spacecraft in LEO must be prevented because of their potentially 
disastrous consequences (see appendix C, section C.1.2.3).  The four types of arcs which 
shall be prevented are as follows: 
</p>
<p> 
a. Solar array or power system trigger arcs (see appendix C, section C.1.2) 
b. Sustained solar array arcs (see appendix C, section C.1.2.3.1)  
c. Dielectric breakdown of structure surface coatings (can also become 
</p>
<p>sustained, see appendix C, section C.1.2.3.1)  
d. Paschen discharges (see appendix B, section B.2, and appendix D, section D.2.3) 
</p>
<p>4.1.2 Large Parasitic Current Drains 
 
Large parasitic current drains to the LEO plasma can lead to power losses and will be 
prevented. Steps will be taken to limit their effects if they cannot be prevented. 
</p>
<p>4.1.3 Simulated LEO Plasma Environment Test 
</p>
<p>Spacecraft systems susceptible to arcing or large parasitic current drains shall be tested in 
a simulated LEO plasma environment under simulated (worst-case) operational 
conditions before flight. 
</p>
<p>4.1.4 LEO versus GEO Charging 
</p>
<p>Prevention and mitigation techniques appropriate in the prevention of arcing in GEO can 
not be the same as those for LEO spacecraft.  Spacecraft that operate a significant amount 
of time in LEO must use arc prevention and mitigation techniques appropriate for the 
LEO environment. 
 
4.1.5 Arc Prevention Techniques 
 
</p>
<p>a.  Solar array or power system trigger arcs may be prevented with any or all of 
the following (see appendix D, section D.2.4.2): 
</p>
<p> 
(1)   Limit the potential of possible arc-sites to a voltage lower than the trigger 
</p>
<p>arc threshold (which must be determined by testing).  This task can be 
achieved by all or one of the following: 
A. Using power system voltages lower than the threshold.  </p>

</p>
<p>21 of 82 
</p>
<p>B. Limiting electron collection to solar arrays by using welded-through 
interconnects (see appendix C, section C.1.1.1) or closely spaced 
coverslides (C.1.1.4.1).  
</p>
<p>C. Encapsulating exposed electron-collecting conductors (see appendix 
D, section D.2.3, but be careful of creating Paschen discharge 
conditions).  
</p>
<p>D. Using a plasma contactor with a grounded neutralizer (see appendix D, 
section D.2.2). 
</p>
<p> 
(2) Limit the electric fields of potential arc-sites.  This task can be achieved 
</p>
<p>by one of all of the following: 
A. Limiting power system voltages to below the trigger arc threshold 
</p>
<p>(which must be determined by testing).  
B. Using (slightly) conductive coverslides or otherwise preventing sharp 
</p>
<p>triple-points (see appendix C, section C.1.2.3).  
C. Using wrap-through interconnects (see appendix C, section C.1.1.1).  
D. Grouting the edges of cells (see appendix D, section D.2.3). 
E. Using cell coverslides with a large overhang.  
F. Using thick coverslides. 
</p>
<p> 
(3) Eliminate arc-sites; i.e., effectively encapsulate all exposed conductors 
</p>
<p>(see appendix D, section D.2.3, but be careful of creating Paschen 
discharge conditions).  This elimination can be achieved by one or all of 
the following: 
A. Using very large coverslides that cover an entire array segment.  
B. Using concentrator arrays with fully grouted solar cells.  
C. Using thin-film coatings that are thick enough to have a dielectric 
</p>
<p>strength higher than (can stand-off) the full array voltage.   
D. Openings in vented experiment electronics enclosures shall have 
</p>
<p>smaller dimensions than the minimum Debye length expected in the 
LEO environment (see appendix D, section D.2.3.1). 
</p>
<p> 
b. Sustained solar array arcs may be prevented with any or all of the following 
</p>
<p>(but see also appendix D, section D.2.4.2): 
 
</p>
<p>(1) Prevent all occurrences of trigger arcs (see section 4.1.5a above). 
 
(2) Limit the differential potentials of adjacent solar array strings, cells, or 
</p>
<p>power traces to below the sustained arcing threshold (which must be 
determined by testing).  This task can be achieved by using power system 
string voltages lower than the sustained arcing voltage threshold and/or </p>

</p>
<p>22 of 82 
</p>
<p>using string layouts that prevent adjacent cells or strings from having large 
differential voltages. 
</p>
<p> 
(3)   Prevent trigger arc plasmas from reaching adjacent cells or strings.  This 
</p>
<p>task can be achieved by

</p>
<p>voltages with adjacent cells or strings.  
B. Erecting physical barriers to plasma movement, and/or spacing 
</p>
<p>adjacent strings far from each other.   
C. The arcing thresholds for geometries intended to mitigate sustained 
</p>
<p>arcing must be determined by testing. 
 
</p>
<p>(4) Prevent trigger arc plasmas from initiating Paschen discharge at the 
differential voltage between strings or cells.  The Paschen minimum for 
most materials that can be evolved during a trigger arc can only be 
determined by testing.  Without an extensive test program to determine 
these thresholds, this technique can only be implemented by using solar 
array materials that do not decompose under the high heat of an arc.  This 
excludes the use of Kapton®, certain adhesives, and non-refractory metals 
in solar array construction. 
 
</p>
<p>(5) Limit currents at arc-sites to below the sustained arcing current threshold 
(which must be determined by testing).  This goal can be achieved by one 
of the following: 
A. Using blocking diodes in string circuits to prevent string arc-current 
</p>
<p>communication.  
B. Using solar cells of current output below the sustained arcing current 
</p>
<p>threshold.  
C. Using RC time constants in solar array strings that are much longer 
</p>
<p>than trigger arc timescales. 
 
</p>
<p>(6) Prevent arcs from extending in duration to milliseconds or more.  This 
task can be achieved by sensing arc occurrence and quickly (&lt;200 
microsecond) open-circuiting strings where arcs occur (see appendix D, 
section D.2.4. 
</p>
<p> 
c. Dielectric breakdown of structure surface coatings will be prevented with any 
</p>
<p>or all of the following (but see also appendix D, section D.2.4.2): 
 
</p>
<p>(1) Keep electric fields in the coatings below the breakdown voltage set by the 
dielectric strength of the coating.  This limitation can be achieved by one 
of the following: 
A. Using low power system voltages.  
B. Letting the solar array float with respect to the system ground.  </p>

appendix D, section D.2.1).  
</p>
<p>F. Using a plasma contactor with a grounded neutralizer. 
G. Using thick dielectric coatings with a high breakdown voltage.  
H. Using very thin dielectric coatings with bulk resistivity low enough 
</p>
<p>that the surface potential is close to the underlying conductor potential 
(but be careful that the capacitance across the coating doesn’t become 
great enough to exacerbate arc damage when arcs occur). 
</p>
<p> 
(2) Prevent sustained dielectric breakdowns (sizzle arcs) by preventing the 
</p>
<p>original dielectric breakdown (see above), or by preventing the 
spacecraft’s electron current collection from reaching the sustained arc 
threshold (which must be determined by testing) for the dielectric 
material.  This task can be achieved by one of the following: 
A. Limiting the power system voltage to below the snapover voltage 
</p>
<p>(which must be determined by testing, see appendix C, section 
C.1.1.4.3).  
</p>
<p>B. Using a  power system grounded at or near its most positive end (see 
appendix D, section D.2.1).  
</p>
<p>C. Encapsulating all exposed electron collecting conductors, or by other 
techniques for limiting electron current collection (see below). 
</p>
<p> 
d.  Paschen discharges will be prevented with any or all of the following: 
</p>
<p> 
(1) Keep potentials of exposed conductors below the Paschen minimum for all 
</p>
<p>ambient and emitted gases (see appendix D, section D.1).  This goal can 
be achieved by one or all of the following: 
A. Using very low power system voltages. 
B. Encapsulating exposed electron-collecting conductors (but be careful 
</p>
<p>of creating Paschen discharge conditions below the encapsulation).  
C. Using a plasma contactor with a grounded neutralizer. 
 
</p>
<p>(2) Prevent the neutral pressure from entering the Paschen regime for the 
 spacecraft plasma sheath dimensions.  This task can be achieved by the 
 following:

<p>APPENDIX A 
OVERVIEW OF PLASMA INTERACTIONS 
</p>
<p> 
A.1 Poisson Equation 
 
When energized conductors are exposed to plasma, positive surfaces collect electrons and 
negative surfaces collect ions.  The Poisson equation governs potential distributions 
which determine charge movement. The Poisson Equation is  
 
</p>
<p> ,42 πρϕ −=∇         (eqn. A.1.1) 
 
where φ is the potential, and ρ is the charge density. When the charge density is very low, 
as in GEO, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation. 
 
Electrons, which are much lighter and more mobile than ions, are collected more easily.  
Surfaces, therefore, charge to whatever potential necessary for the net current flow to be 
zero in equilibrium.  A current loop forms that uses the ionosphere as part of the 
conducting path.  The potential that any given surface will achieve is very difficult to 
model and generally requires full-up testing in a plasma environment.  The resulting 
interactions can be summarized as follows: 
 
</p>
<p>a.   Surfaces that are more negative than ≈ 100 V with respect to their 
surroundings are subject to arcing.  These arcs can be either plasma arcs or arcs to 
adjacent conductors.  They are usually a momentary discharge of accumulated energy, 
lasting only milliseconds, but under some conditions can be sustained.  The necessary 
conditions for the arc to be sustained are for the current and voltage to be maintained 
above threshold values.  Plasma arc thresholds are poorly known but can be as low as -50 
V under some conditions. 
</p>
<p> 
b.   Surfaces that are more negative than ≈ 100 V are subject to ion bombardment 
</p>
<p>and sputtering.  Since the dominant ion is atomic oxygen, care must be taken that 
chemical attack does not occur as well. 
</p>
<p> 
c. Surfaces that are positive can easily collect sufficient electrons to present a 
</p>
<p>measurable power drain to the system.  Referred to as “parasitic current collection,” this 
condition can result in a few percent power loss to the system. </p>

d.  If the power system is negatively grounded, as is most commonly done, the 
</p>
<p>entire vehicle can float negative with respect to the ionosphere.  The system potential can 
become as negative with respect to the ionosphere as the entire power system voltage.  
For systems with very large areas of high voltage surfaces, such as the International 
Space Station (ISS), this effect is large, requiring a plasma contactor to mitigate it. Note 
that when ISS has its plasma contactor (grounded to the structure) operating, current 
collection from the plasma of the solar arrays is exacerbated, because the arrays will be 
held at positive potentials with respect to the surrounding plasma.

<p>APPENDIX B 
ENVIRONMENTS 
</p>
<p>B.1 The Ambient Environment 
</p>
<p>B.1.1 The Neutral Atmosphere 
</p>
<p>The dominant environment between 100 and 1000 km is the neutral atmosphere.  In this 
essentially collision-less regime, the gases are in hydrostatic equilibrium.  Below about 100 
km, where the atmosphere is homogeneous, the composition is approximately 80 percent 
N2 and 18 percent O2 with traces of NO2, Ar, and other gases.  Above 100 km, atomic 
oxygen, the result of photo-dissociation of molecular oxygen comes to dominate.  Above 
about 800 km the atmosphere is largely atomic hydrogen.  At a 500 km altitude, the neutral 
number density varies from 2x106 to 3x108 cm-3, depending on solar activity and position 
in the orbit.  The kinetic temperature of the gas is usually between 500 and 2000 K, and the 
ambient pressure is in the range of 10-10 to 5x10-8 Torr.   
 
The neutral gas environment has been well explored and quantified.  Empirical models 
based on in-situ neutral composition and satellite drag measurements have evolved over 
the years into reliable predictors of the average composition and thermal structure of the  
thermosphere.  The most notable of these models are the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent 
Scatter (MSIS-86) model (Hedin, 1987; Prag, 1983)  based on in-situ satellite 
observations of neutral concentrations, the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) version 
of the Jacchia model derived from satellite drag measurements, the Marshall Engineering 
Thermosphere (MET) (“Computational procedure,” 1970; Hickey, 1988) and the U.S. 
Standard Atmosphere (“U.S. standard,” 1976; King, 1978).  These models provide good 
estimates of the thermosphere environment as functions of altitude, longitude, latitude, 
local time, magnetic activity, and solar activity and are continually updated as new 
information becomes available.   
</p>
<p>B.1.2 The Plasma Environment  
</p>
<p>On the sunlit hemisphere of the Earth, ultraviolet (UV) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) 
radiation penetrates the atmosphere, ionizing and exciting the molecules present.  This 
results in a fine balance between increasing density and increasing absorption that leads 
to the formation of layers, the ionosphere.  A highly dynamic plasma, the ionosphere’s 
properties vary with altitude, latitude, time of day, and sunspot cycle.  Over hours to 
weeks, local geomagnetic disturbances can cause dramatic variations that are difficult to 
predict.  Despite these complications, the broad features of the ionosphere can be 
described with simple models. 
 
The variability with latitude, known since the 1920s, is so dramatic that the ionosphere is 
conventionally divided into three distinct regions: high-latitude, mid-latitude, and low-
latitude.  The easiest region to understand is the mid-latitude region, which most closely </p>

</p>
<p>30 of 82 
</p>
<p>follows classical ionospheric models.  In this document, spacecraft design is not treated 
for the high-latitude region. 
 
Variation with altitude is perhaps the most important parameter for the spacecraft 
designer.  This pronounced vertical structure is not simply a matter of height variation but 
reflects basic physical processes that differ in the resulting regions.  Three processes, in 
particular, are responsible: (1) the sun’s energy is deposited at various heights because of 
the absorption characteristics of the atmosphere, (2) the physics of recombination 
depends on density and therefore on altitude, and (3) composition of the atmosphere 
changes with height. 
 
The lower limit of the ionosphere is somewhat arbitrary since plasma production falls off 
continuously with decreasing height.  Historically, the ionosphere has been assumed to 
begin about 50 km from the surface, because this is the altitude where plasma density 
becomes sufficient to affect radio wave propagation noticeably.  There is no distinct 
upper limit, but 2000 km is generally used for most practical applications.  In this 
document, spacecraft design for altitudes above 1000 km is not specified, because of the 
radiation issues that are a primary design driver. 
 
Four layers describe the vertical structure of the ionosphere.  In order of increasing 
altitude and increasing plasma density, these are designated as D, E, F1, and F2 regions.  
Their properties are summarized in table 1.

Beyond the peak in the F2 layer, electron density decreases monotonically out to several 
Earth-radii.  For altitudes up to and including the F2 peak, thermal energies of the 
electrons and ions are in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 eV, corresponding to kinetic temperatures 
of 1200 to 2400 K.  Temperature rises monotonically beyond this point, reaching several 
thousand eV in geosynchronous orbits. 
 
The F2 layer is the most important for spacecraft operations.  It is in this layer that ISS 
lives, the Shuttle orbiter and most LEO spacecraft fly, and the Hubble telescope orbits to </p>

<p>photograph the universe.  Its boundaries and electron density are highly variable, with a 
general erratic behavior imposed on large daily, seasonal, and solar cycle variations. 
 
Ionospheric plasma distributions within the F-region have been extensively explored 
since the advent of bottom-side sounders, long before in-situ satellite observations were 
made.  As a result, the general morphology of the F-region and some of its more 
prominent individual features are well understood.  While there are detailed features such 
as localized troughs, localized heating, and short temporal variations that are difficult to 
model, the overall global structure of the ionosphere is now well understood, and 
excellent ionospheric models exist for estimating and quantifying plasma distributions.  
In particular, the global International Reference Ionosphere model  (IRI-90, for example) 
provides estimates under varying solar activity conditions of plasma concentrations, 
composition, and temperatures as a function of altitude, time, and location.  Another good 
reference is BSR/AIAA G-003B-2004, American National Standard, “Guide to 
Reference and Standard Atmosphere Models.” 
</p>
<p>B.2 The Spacecraft-Induced Environment 
</p>
<p>Spacecraft-induced environments can take many forms:  neutral gases, ionized gases 
(plasmas), condensable gases, particulates, radiation, etc.  In many cases, these 
environments can overwhelm the natural environment and can lead to undesirable 
interactions.  Below, these types of environments are treated separately. 
 
Cold gas thrusters and Reaction Control System (attitude thrusters) (RCS) can 
significantly increase the localized neutral pressure.  This increase can be dangerous 
when there are exposed high voltage conductors, because Paschen discharges can occur 
(see appendix D, section D.2.3).  In general, if the local neutral pressure is more than a 
milliTorr and less than a few Torr, high voltage electrical breakdowns can occur.  At a 
voltage of -3500 V relative to the Orbiter, the Tethered Satellite System – first reflight 
(TSS-1R) tether leaked gas into its deployer control reel enclosures and the elevated 
neutral pressure led to Paschen discharge and loss of the mission (Szalai et al., 1996).  On 
the Solar Array Module Plasma Interactions Experiment (SAMPIE, Ferguson and Hillard, 
1997) Shuttle payload bay experiment, a local gas vent had to be moved to prevent 
Paschen discharge.  Helium is the most dangerous neutral effluent gas, since it has the 
lowest Paschen breakdown minimum voltage. 
 
Ionized gases can be emitted by plasma sources such as hollow cathode plasma 
contactors or from neutral gas sources at high positive potentials.  Locally, the plasma 
density can be greater than the ambient plasma density, and similar plasma interactions 
can occur with high voltage components.  On ISS, the plasma contacting units (PCUs), 
when operating, produce a local xenon plasma of much greater density than ambient. It 
has been estimated that the invisible plasma ball produced is some eight meters in radius 
before its density decreases below the ambient plasma density in LEO.  Arcing and 
current collection from such a plasma could occur in much the same way as with an </p>

<p>ambient plasma, implying that solar arrays and other active sites should be kept out of 
induced plasma plumes. 
 
Condensable gases are effluents that can condense on cold components and contaminate 
their surfaces.  Oil and water vapor are two major condensables that can influence the 
interactions of spacecraft surfaces.  In vacuum chamber testing, oil has been shown to 
prevent snapover on surfaces when high positive voltages are used (see section C.1.1.4.3 
below).  Many oils, however, cannot withstand the LEO atomic oxygen environment on 
ram-facing surfaces but can build up on wake surfaces.  Water vapor released on the 
night side can condense on insulating surfaces of solar arrays, etc., and can participate in 
arcing when the arrays become active in sunlight.  It has been shown in laboratory testing 
that solar arrays that have been thoroughly baked out (heated in a vacuum for seven days) 
lose the water vapor contamination that is important in low voltage (-100 to -300 V) 
arcing (Vayner et al., 2002).  In LEO, however, a cold cycle is about 1/3 of every orbit.  
Even very well baked-out systems can have recondensation from effluents evolved 
during the night side of the orbit.  Thin layers of condensed contaminants can concentrate 
electric fields above high voltage conductors, even to the point where they undergo 
dielectric breakdown. 
 
Particulates can be emitted or shaken from surfaces, but can also result from arcing or 
sputtering from spacecraft surfaces.  Particulates can transfer small amounts of charge 
from one surface to another, but their major effect is in changing the characteristics of the 
surfaces to which they adhere.  For instance, an insulating particle on a conductor that is 
at a high potential can concentrate the electric field structure locally, possibly leading to a 
reduced arcing voltage threshold. 
 
Radiation can embed electrons deep within dielectrics where they can build up for days, 
weeks, or months until the dielectric breaks down under the induced electric field.  In the 
natural environment, this effect will mainly happen in the auroral zones, radiation belts, 
and above the South Atlantic Anomaly, and thus are not usually important in the 
environment for which this standard is applicable, but radiation produced on or within a 
spacecraft can be important regardless of orbital position.  Satellites using radioactive 
power sources must be designed to ameliorate this “deep-dielectric” charging, which is 
different from the typical “surface” spacecraft charging.

PLASMA INTERACTIONS

<p> 
C.1 Exposed High Voltage Conductors 
 
It is almost always unwise to allow exposed high voltage (|V| &gt; 55 V) conductors on 
spacecraft. Exposed high voltage conductors that do not exhibit corona or Paschen 
breakdown in a neutral gas can readily do so if the environment contains a significant 
ionized component.  Although a high voltage surface—solar cell interconnects, for 
example—can be exposed to the ionized space plasma by design, surfaces can also be at 
high voltages because of current collection from the plasma.  The resulting equilibrium 
potentials that are assumed by surfaces result in the following effects and are described in 
the sections that follow: 
</p>
<p> 
a. Floating potential shifts:  In equilibrium, some parts of the spacecraft can be 
</p>
<p>charged to negative voltages near the maximum string voltage of the solar array. 
 
b. Parasitic power drain:  Direct loss of power due to current collection. This loss 
</p>
<p>can be several percent of total power. 
 
c. Sputtering:  Surfaces that charge negative will attract ions that in turn will result 
</p>
<p>in sputtering of the material. 
 
d. Arcing:  Negative surfaces undergo arcing when some critical threshold is 
</p>
<p>exceeded. 
</p>
<p>C.1.1 Current Collection 
</p>
<p>C.1.1.1 The Current-Balance Condition 
 
In the weakly ionized low-density plasma found in LEO, current collection is completely 
described by Poisson’s equation (eqn. A.1.1)Positive surfaces readily attract electrons and 
negative surfaces attract the much more massive positive ions only with great difficulty.  Since in 
equilibrium, net current collection must be zero, surfaces will charge to equalize the net current of 
each polarity. 
 
To illustrate the basic effects, consider first a hypothetical experiment.  Suppose two 
metal spheres a few feet in diameter are initially connected by a conductor and placed in 
LEO some distance apart.  Since electrons are collected more easily than ions, both 
spheres will charge to the same potential, within a volt or two of plasma potential.  Now 
suppose a high voltage battery is placed between them with one sphere connected to the 
negative terminal and the other to the positive.  On Earth, in air, such an arrangement 
would result in half of the battery voltage appearing on each sphere.  But in LEO, highly </p>

</p>
<p>34 of 82 
</p>
<p>mobile electrons stream to the positive sphere while the negative sphere struggles to 
collect the massive ions.  Both experience and modeling indicate that approximately 90 
percent of the battery voltage will appear on the negative sphere and only 10 percent will 
be on the positive one with respect to the plasma potential. 
 
The implications of this phenomenon are considerable and often expensive.  In the case 
of ISS, for example, the power system consists of solar arrays wired in a series-parallel 
arrangement to give a 160-volt system.  Since the main structure of ISS is “grounded” to 
the negative end of the array string, the entire space station would “float” more than 
140V negative with respect to the ionosphere.  Such potentials are beyond the dielectric 
strength of the anodized coatings on the ISS aluminum structure, and would lead to 
arcing into the space plasma and eventual destruction of the ISS thermal control system. 
This prospect required the addition of an active plasma contactor, a xenon hollow cathode 
discharge unit, to effectively ground the space station to the ionosphere.  As it turns out, 
the ISS solar arrays are unusual in that they are poor electron collectors because of their 
welded-through design.  Atypically, the ISS early mission-build structure usually doesn’t 
charge more than 20 volts or so negative with respect to the surrounding plasma even 
without the plasma contactors operating.  However, as more solar arrays are put up, it is 
expected that the charging level on ISS will increase dramatically, justifying the added 
expense of the plasma contactors (Ferguson and Gardner, 2002). 
 
For conducting surfaces that are covered with insulators, some elapsed time could be 
necessary for the steady state potential situation to be reached.  The surfaces will charge 
until no further charge collection is necessary in equilibrium, and this is tantamount to 
charging up a capacitor with plate separation equal to the insulator thickness.  Ion 
charging times in LEO can be considerable for typical anodized aluminum thicknesses.  It 
is estimated, for instance, that in the daytime ionosphere, ISS surfaces will take 4 seconds 
to fully charge, whereas on the morning terminator where the ionospheric ion density is 
at its lowest, charging times of 40 seconds or more can occur.   
</p>
<p>C.1.1.2 Sheath Effects 
</p>
<p>A positively charged spherical electrode will collect electrons when inserted in a plasma.  
The volume called the “sheath,” in which the electrode influences electrons, is larger than 
the sphere.  For low voltages, the sheath thickness will be nearly the same as the Debye 
length (see equation. in appendix D, section D.2.3.1).  Some electrons will orbit around 
the electrode and escape from the sheath.  The collected or trapped electrons are said to 
be orbit-limited and are affected in a complex manner by the radius of the electrode, the 
electrode voltages, and the temperature and density of the free electrons. 
   
A solar array looks to the plasma like a large rod electrode (like the wires and 
interconnects that are in contact with the plasma) rather than a spherical probe, and is also 
surrounded by a sheath.  Power loss caused by plasma leakage current will become 
significant above 100 V for positive electrodes (see section following). Above a threshold </p>

C.1.1.3 Current Collection by Structures 
</p>
<p>C.1.1.3.1 Electron Collection  
</p>
<p>LEO spacecraft are traveling subsonically with respect to the electrons in the ambient 
plasma.  That is, at the plasma temperatures in LEO, the ambient electrons are moving at 
speeds greatly in excess of the orbital velocity.  Thus, electrons can be collected on any 
conducting surface (exposed to the undisturbed plasma, i.e., not in the plasma wake) that 
is not charged more than a few electron temperatures negative.  In general, electron 
collection is well described by probe theory.  See for example Chen, 1965.  For large 
surfaces, collection is best described by thin sheath probe theory.  For structures smaller 
than a few times the Debye length (see equation. in appendix D, section D.2.3.1), orbit-
limited theory can be used.  Electron current collected from a plasma can be described by 
the equation Ie = J0As, where Ie is the electron current, As is the effective surface area for 
electron collection (either the plasma sheath area or the area of a sphere with the limiting 
orbit radius), and J0 is the electron thermal flux, given by  
 
J0 = (ne/4)(8kTe/πme)1/2  = 2.68x10-12 nTe1/2  Amps/cm2,    (eqn. C.1.3.1.1) 
 
where n is the electron density per cm3, and Te is the electron temperature in eV.  For 
example, in a “typical” LEO plasma of 106 electrons/cm3 and a temperature of 0.1 eV, 
one could expect electron thermal fluxes of about 1.5 microamps/cm2, or about 15 
milliamps/m2. 
 
Electron current collection by wires is important in the case of electrodynamic tethers or 
when structures such as self-extending masts with wire braces are used.  For instance, on 
ISS it was found that several square meters of electron-collecting wires on the array 
masts were connected to ISS ground.  The array wing that was positive with respect to 
the plasma because of lv

perpendicular to the velocity vector and the Earth’s magnetic field.  A satellite at its 
upper end collected electrons, and an electron gun at the lower end emitted electrons to 
complete the circuit.  When the electron gun was not in operation, a large resistance 
prevented the Shuttle from being biased thousands of volts negative of its surrounding 
plasma.  However, there remained a large voltage between the tether lower end and the 
Shuttle orbiter. This enormous bias eventually led to a continuous arc on the tether (see 
section C.1.2.3.1 below), which broke, freeing the satellite and ending the experiment.  
During the arc, the satellite collected over 1 amp of electron current to keep the arc going.  
Probe theory (Cohen et al., 1986) is usually used to calculate the total current collected 
by a wire with distributed potentials.  However, before the break, TSS-1R demonstrated 
that a satellite at a high positive potential could collect an anomalously large electron 
current.  See  Zhang et al., 2000; Stone &amp; Raitt, 1998; and Stone et al., 1998. 
 
In the MSFC tether experiment, ProSEDS, the Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer 
System (Vaughn et al., (2004), the electrodynamic tether would  be a bare wire, 
collecting current along its length, rather than just at its ends.  In this case, arc mitigation 
requires, for example, graded insulation at the tether ends to eliminate the so-called 
triple-points where high electric fields can lead to arcing.   
 
Electron collection in LEO is also affected by the vehicle plasma wake.  Since orbiting 
LEO spacecraft are moving supersonically with respect to the ambient ions, there is a 
wake devoid of ions behind each spacecraft.  The electrons that initially enter the wake 
build up a space charge that repels all other electrons, so the wake can be considered 
essentially devoid of electrons, compared to the ambient plasma.  For most bodies, then, 
the only part that can collect ambient electrons is the ram-facing side.  The Charging 
Hazards and Wake Studies (CHAWS) experiment (Cooke et al., 1994; Bonito et al., 
1996) showed that a large body in LEO has a very deep wake, with a wake electron 
density of 10-4 of the ambient electron density or less, but with a temperature 10 times or 
so of the ambient, in agreement with earlier measurements by Raitt et al. (1984) and 
Murphy et al. (1986). 
 
If a piece of conductive structure is surrounded by insulating material and is at a high 
positive potential relative to the ambient plasma, it could be subject to snapover (see 
section C.1.1.4.3 below), causing a greatly increased effective electron surface area, so 
the structure can collect an order of magnitude more current than one would naively 
suspect. 
 
Insulating structure surfaces reach equilibrium potential with the LEO plasma of only a 
few volts negative, and do not thereafter collect current (Vaughn, 2003) </p>

<p>C.1.1.3.2  Ion Collection 
</p>
<p>While electrons are collected from all directions in LEO, spacecraft in LEO are moving 
supersonically with respect to the ions; therefore, ions are collected only by ram surfaces.  
In fact, since many conducting parts of a structure are far greater in dimension than the 
plasma sheath, the effective flux of ions to their surfaces is essentially equal to the ram 
flux of ions on their front-facing surfaces.  That is, F = n v, where n is the electron (and 
ion) number density, and v is the spacecraft velocity.  If we let Aram be the ram-facing 
conductor projected area, and if we let Ii be the ion current and q the ion charge, 
 
Ii = q n v Aram,         (eqn. C.1.1.3.2) 
 
which for LEO circular orbit becomes 1.2x10-15 n Aram amps.  For a density of about 
1012/m-3, this gives a current of about 1 mA/m2.  This, then is a convenient rule of thumb 
for LEO ion current, about 1 mA per square meter. 
 
Notice that for most purposes, the collected ion current depends only on the electron (and 
ion) density, whereas the electron current depends on the electron temperature, as well.  
To first order, then, when there is a current balance condition determining the floating 
potential, only changes in the electron temperature will cause changes in the floating 
potential. 
 
Insulating ram surfaces will float at a potential such that the ram ion and thermal electron 
currents are equal, or only a few volts negative at the most.

<p>C.1.1.4   Current Collection by Solar Arrays 
</p>
<p>C.1.1.4.1  Electron Collection  
</p>
<p>Electrons can be collected on positively charged cells of solar arrays by the cell 
interconnects, wiring traces, or cell edges.  Solar array electron collection is intimately 
related to parasitic power drain, which is treated later in this document.  However, here 
the discussion will be in more general terms. 
 
For arrays that have fully exposed interconnects, cell edges, or power traces, electron 
collection is similar to that for wires or small spheres of the same total collecting area as 
the exposed conductors.  One significant difference is that many solar cells have 
insulating coverslides.  Since solar arrays by definition generate a voltage across each 
string, some of the solar cells, interconnects, or wiring will be at very different voltages 
than other parts.  If a solar array string has 400 silicon solar cells in series, for instance, 
one end of the string will be about 200 V more positive than the other.  The total electron 
current collected will be the integral of the collection of all the cells at their respective 
potentials away from the plasma potential.  This depends, of course, on what the system 
ground is, and what the floating potential of the system is.  Wherever the system floats </p>

</p>
<p>38 of 82 
</p>
<p>with respect to the ambient plasma, only the cells and traces with positive potentials will 
collect many electrons.   
 
If the array’s exposed conductors are partially hidden from the ambient plasma (such as 
being underneath overhanging coverslides or between closely spaced solar cells) the 
coverslides can change the electron collection greatly.  It has been shown that a 
coverslide with an overhang at least as big as the cell-plus-adhesive thickness will block 
electron collection at the cell edge very effectively, cutting it by a few orders of 
magnitude.  Also, cell edges on cells that are separated by less than about 32 mils have 
greatly reduced electron collection (Chock, 1991b).  One way of thinking about this 
reduced electron collection is that it becomes difficult or impossible for thermal electrons 
to “make the turn” to be collected at the cell edges.  For such solar arrays, it is often the 
case that the lower the ambient electron temperature, the greater the electron collection, 
since more of the ambient electrons can “make the turn.”  This is the case for the ISS 
arrays, where the greatest amount of electron collection, and thus the worst system 
charging, occurs when the ambient electron temperature is the lowest.  
 
It is possible for the solar arrays to undergo snapover if they are at high enough positive 
potentials.  (See appendix C, section C.1.1.4.3 for details.)  It is believed that snapover 
depends on the secondary electron emission characteristics of the solar array insulators.  
Contamination and/or texturing by atomic oxygen can decrease snapover.  In ground 
tests, oil contamination was seen to prevent snapover completely on some samples.  If 
snapover does occur, it is possible for the solar array to have an effective electron 
collection area as great as its entire geometrical area, rather than the tiny fraction of the 
array area that is normally occupied by interconnects or cell edges. 
 
The solar array itself can provide a wake to block its own electron collection.  For a sun-
pointing array in equatorial LEO, the electron collection will be at a maximum near 
sunrise, and will shut off about noon when the array goes into its own wake.  Of course, 
at night when the plasma is not dense and the array is not generating voltage, electron 
collection will be minimal.  Thus, solar array electron collection in LEO is only 
important, and can only lead to a great deal of system charging, for about 1/3 of each 
orbit (the morning side). 
</p>
<p>C.1.1.4.2  Ion Collection  
</p>
<p>Snapover does not occur for ions, and the ion collection for solar arrays is almost always 
a linear function of negative voltage.  Again, the total array collection is the integrated 
value of all negative cells at their respective potentials away from the ambient plasma, 
but for most solar arrays, this collection is small compared to ion collection from the 
structure.  In the case of ISS, for example, Ferguson and Gardner (2002) could 
completely ignore solar array ion collection in modeling the ISS floating potential.  When 
the array is in its wake, ion collection is further reduced. </p>

<p>C.1.1.4.3  Snapover 
</p>
<p>The phenomenon of snapover was observed in the early 1980s when power system 
designers first began experiments with high voltage arrays.  Although the process is 
broadly understood, many of the details are controversial and remain an active area of 
research. 
  
Suppose a flat conducting plate is covered with an insulator and in this insulation there is 
a pinhole.  If the plate is biased by a power supply and placed in plasma, it will collect 
current.  For low voltages, current collection will be linear with bias voltage.  Although 
the remaining surface cannot collect charge, it nevertheless is the source of an increasing 
electric field.  This field results in ion bombardment of the insulator and secondary 
electron emission.  The result is a rapidly growing sheath that collects charge and funnels 
it effectively to the pinhole. What is observed then is this:  As voltage is increased from 
zero, current is collected linearly.  At some point, current collection increases 
exponentially and finally saturates at a current level that is approximately the same as if 
the entire plate were conducting.  On a solar array, the interconnects, wire traces, or cell 
edges act like pinholes; they are the conductors to which the current is funneled.  The 
solar cell substrate and/or coverslides act like the insulator in the above example; they are 
the dielectric that furnishes the secondary electrons, and they act as a current-collecting 
plate. 
 
The phenomenon is quite striking with conventional solar array designs and is easily 
observed in plasma test chambers.  Here these are solar cells that are covered by 
insulating cover slides connected to each other by small, exposed metallic interconnects.  
At low voltages the interconnects collect current roughly linearly with voltage.  At 
around 150-200 volts the onset of snapover can be observed and by about 600 volts the 
array is fully snapped over. 
   
Avoiding snapover has become a major design issue.  Strategies include insulating all 
surfaces, where practical, and choosing insulators with low secondary electron emission 
yields.  While simply insulating all conducting surfaces provides initial protection, cracks 
or pinholes are difficult to avoid when materials must withstand years of exposure to 
harsh space conditions.  It should be noted that pinholes in high voltage insulation usually 
expand as the large current density funneled through them destroys additional material.  
On the other hand, experience has shown that cracks or pinholes, if much smaller than the 
Debye length in the plasma, do not snap over.  (λD = 743(Te/n)1/2, in cm, where Te is the 
electron temperature in eV, and n is the electron density in cm-3.  (See eqn. D.2.3.1 in 
appendix D, section D.2.3.1.  For LEO conditions, λD can be as small as 0.1 cm.)  
</p>
<p> 
As an example of a snapover-like effect on real solar arrays, consider the data in figure 1.  
The Advanced Photovoltaic Solar Array (APSA) was a very lightweight design proposed 
for widespread use in the early 1990s.  Originally designed for deployment in GEO, the 
blanket material was carbon-loaded Kapton®, which had sufficient conductivity to avoid </p>

<p>the differential charging that is a common problem in that environment.  Proposals to 
adapt APSA technology to LEO recognized that atomic oxygen would destroy the 
blanket material within a matter of days.  The LEO prototype was therefore designed 
with a blanket of Germanium-coated Kapton®, which would be resistant to atomic 
oxygen attack.  This material is not as conducting as carbon but is still a weak conductor.

<p> 
Three sample coupons were constructed that were as close to identical as possible except 
for the blanket material.  One was made from uncoated Kapton®, and the other two had 
blankets coated with Carbon and Germanium, respectively.  They were tested in a space 
simulation chamber for current collection as a function of applied bias voltage.  As the 
results show, the highly insulating Kapton®-H, shown in figure 1 by the curve designated 
“H,” collected current linearly until around 300 volts.  Current rose rapidly until about 
400 volts when it became exponential, the signature of snapover.  The weakly conducting 
Germanium-coated blanket collected linearly only until about 125 volts when it began its 
rapid rise, and the much more conducting Carbon blanket collected exponentially almost 
from the beginning.  These experiments showed that the blanket itself could become 
involved in the snapover process and pointed to the critical need to test all proposed array 
coatings for plasma effects (Hillard, 1994). That is, with conductive blankets, the inherent

C.1.1.4.4  Parasitic Power Drain  
</p>
<p>Current collection from solar arrays or other conducting surfaces not only poses the threat 
of damage to the surfaces involved, but also can reach levels that result in a significant 
loss of power.  Many efforts have taken place over the years to use the basic equations of 
plasma physics to estimate the magnitude of this loss, and one of them is presented here 
to illustrate the effect. 
 
The high-voltage solar-cell array for a high-power satellite looks more like a sheet 
electrode than like a spherical probe.  K. L. Kennerud developed a method of analyzing 
the leakage current from such arrays based on fundamental equations developed by I. 
Langmuir (Kennerud, 1974).  Kennerud’s technique converts the linear array into a 
sphere having the same area, and then calculates the radius of the electron sheath 
surrounding the array.  His experiments with small, positively charged solar-cell panels 
correlated well with his predictions. 
 
Kennerud’s results, shown in table 2, can be used to understand how the effect scales 
with altitude for the hypothetical solar array that he used.

Such rough calculations fail when the geometry becomes more complex.  In particular, 
solar arrays with hidden interconnects such as the ISS arrays can collect current very 
differently from one with exposed interconnects.  The ISS solar arrays, counter to 
intuition, collect more current at low electron temperatures than at high electron 
temperatures.  Models have shown this phenomenon is caused by an electric field barrier 
to high-energy electrons.  However, modeling electron collection by using spheres of </p>

<p>equivalent “effective” area is very useful, and is incorporated in computer codes such as 
Environmental WorkBench (EWB), for instance.  Modern computer codes, such as the 
NASA Charging Analyzer Program (NASCAP) series described below, will provide 
accurate estimates of parasitic power loss for any geometry.  At high positive potential 
snapover can make a solar array appear to be completely conductive.  In addition, if a 
glow discharge caused by neutral gas ionization occurs on the array, the current collected 
can shoot up to tremendous levels (Ferguson et al., 1998; Vayner et al., 1999).  Finally, 
electric propulsion thrusters or plasma contactors, if placed in the vicinity of solar arrays, 
can short-circuit the plasma collection circuit and constitute a significant drain on the 
system power supply. 
</p>
<p>C.1.1.5  Current Collection at High Frequencies 
</p>
<p>In general, little work has been done on plasma effects involving high frequency power 
systems.  While significant new effects are not expected, most parameters of interest such 
as corona inception and extinction voltages are expected to exhibit frequency 
dependence.  One effect did emerge in the early 1990s concerning insulated conductors 
energized with 20 kHz AC that were exposed to LEO plasma conditions (Button et al., 
1989).  This work was underway because Space Station Freedom was originally designed 
to use such a power system.  Research was suspended when the Space Station was 
reconfigured to use DC power.  
 
If a conductor energized with low frequency AC is placed in LEO plasma, electrons are 
attracted to the insulating surface during the positive part of the cycle.  These electrons 
“stick” to the material with a characteristic energy and are not repelled when the polarity 
changes to negative.  Ions, however, are attracted during the negative part of the cycle 
and neutralize the electron charge for no net effect.  At high frequencies this 
neutralization process does not occur.  Highly mobile electrons are still attracted during 
the positive part of the cycle but ions, because of the much larger mass, cannot respond to 
the rapidly changing field.  The outer surface therefore charges to a negative potential 
close to the peak voltage on the power system waveform and remains charged.   
 
Although ions cannot respond to the rapidly changing voltage waveform, they do respond 
to the buildup of negative charge on the surface.  The resulting ion flux results in 
equilibrium where the surface is charged, as a rule of thumb, to about 90 percent of the 
peak voltage level used in the system.  For a high voltage system, ions will easily acquire 
sufficient energy to sputter material from the insulation.  Such charging can have a 
number of other implications that could include an arcing hazard, depending on where 
such surfaces are located with respect to other conductors.  </p>

</p>
<p>C.1.1.6  Wake Effects 
</p>
<p>Because a LEO spacecraft is supersonic with respect to the ions it flies through, a wake, 
essentially devoid of plasma particles of both signs, will form behind it.  In LEO, the 
ambient ions are traveling at a thermal speed of about 9.79x105 (Ti/mi)1/2 cm/s, where Ti 
is the ion temperature in eV, and mi is the ion mass in amu.  For a Ti of 0.2 eV (typical) 
and mi = 16 (atomic oxygen), this gives an ion speed of about 1.1x105 cm/s, and a Mach 
ratio of about 5 for LEO orbit.  Thus, the wake of a large body will extend as a cone 
about five times as long as it is wide.  In this region (a sort of umbra), ion and electron 
densities will be severely depressed, and the remaining plasma will be at a high 
temperature (perhaps ten times that of the ambient plasma).  In a surrounding region (a 
kind of penumbra), bounded by the shock wave, the plasma will be disturbed, but it is 
believed that the major effect will be hotter electrons than ambient.  Beyond the 
penumbra, the plasma will be normal (Ferguson, 1985). Measured details of wake 
structure can be found in Raitt et al. (1984) and Murphy et al. (1986). 
 
Instruments to measure plasma parameters in LEO should be placed beyond the plasma 
sheath surrounding the structure (normally a distance of 0.3 to 0.6 meters will suffice) 
and outside the wake of any structural element.  In the case of the floating potential probe 
(FPP) on ISS, a compromise position was chosen that placed FPP outside the umbra of 
any structural element and on a pole to place it outside the plasma sheath, but it could not 
be placed out of the penumbra of some structural elements.  Resulting plasma 
temperatures measured by FPP are considered to be higher than ambient temperatures, 
but the plasma densities seem reasonable.  For instruments in such suboptimal 
placements, calibration must be done to convert measured parameters into ambient 
values, and such work is now proceeding with FPP.  For a detailed discussion of wakes of 
large and small bodies orbiting in LEO, see Samir et al. (1986).  For detailed scientific 
information about wake structure, see the works of N. H. Stone, who has devoted much 
of his life to researching this topic.

<p>C.1.2.1   Solar Array Arcing 
</p>
<p>C.1.2.1.1  Background  
</p>
<p>Until recently, the majority of spacecraft primary power systems used solar arrays and 
rechargeable batteries to supply 28 V.  The choice of 28 volts for the main bus voltage 
was made to take advantage of long-existing standards and practices within the aircraft 
industry. Plasma interactions at 28 V have not been generally considered a degradation 
factor of consequence.  The only noted exceptions to their benign nature have occurred 
under extreme environmental conditions, especially during geomagnetic substorms for 
spacecraft operating at high inclinations.  For low inclination spacecraft, i.e., those that 
completely avoid the auroral oval, 28-volt systems have not been observed to arc.  </p>

As the power requirements for spacecraft increased, however, high voltage solar arrays 
were baselined to minimize total mass and increase power production efficiency.  With 
the advent of 100 V systems in the late 1980s, arcing began to be observed on a number 
of spacecraft. 
 
Solar array arcs are generally characterized by the following parameters.   
</p>
<p> 
a. Breakdown voltage – The voltage required to initiate an arc depends on the 
</p>
<p>plasma flux density, the system bias voltage, insulation, and construction and 
arrangement of the solar cells and solar cell strings.  Breakdown voltage for a well-
designed solar array can initiate as low as 75 V (negative biased) for spacecraft operating 
in a LEO plasma environment.  Vayner et al. (2001) have shown that arc thresholds lower  
than about -300 V are invariably due to surface contamination with water and/or other 
contaminants. 
</p>
<p> 
b. Temporal profile – The time from initiation to maximum current can be from a 
</p>
<p>fraction of a microsecond to seconds, depending on the power source and the circuit 
impedance.  The total duration of an arc can be from microseconds to indefinitely 
sustained. 
</p>
<p> 
c. Current profile – The arc current can be as large as 100 to 1,000 amperes 
</p>
<p>depending on the capacitance of the solar array.  See figure 2, from Snyder (Purvis et al., 
1984).

Although many different taxonomies have been proposed for classifying arcs based on 
combinations of the above properties, these have generally been the work of physicists 
and have been designed to clarify issues for further research.  For the design engineer 
concerned with risk mitigation, the following is a simpler scheme that assigns arcs to 
only two categories. 
</p>
<p> 
(1) Fast transients (primary or trigger arcs):  The most common solar array arcs 
</p>
<p>that are characterized by rapid rise time followed by extinction in a time that 
is several times the rise time.  The critical parameter is that the energy 
involved is stored in whatever capacitance is available.  The available 
capacitance can vary from a single array string to the entire spacecraft, 
depending on design.  These arcs give rise to electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) but otherwise are not generally associated with significant permanent 
damage on small spacecraft.  On ISS and other high-power systems, however, 
the energy stored in the capacitance electrically connected to the arc site could 
cause significant damage to a solar cell or power trace.  Of course, repeated 
arcs at the same arc site can lead to degradation and failure even if the 
individual arcs are not very energetic.

<p>(2) Sustained arcs (continuous arcs):  Events that have been attributed with the 
destruction of on-orbit solar arrays.  Generally, the process begins with a fast 
transient (a so-called “trigger arc”).  Under some conditions, the transient 
develops into a long-lived arc that is fed directly by the entire array, 
effectively becoming a short-circuit.  Such events (called “sustained arcs”) 
invariably involve large quantities of energy and can be severely damaging to 
cells, interconnects, or power traces. 
</p>
<p>Each of these will be discussed in more detail in sections to follow.  Since all events 
begin as a fast transient, and most do not evolve beyond this phase, this type of arc has 
been the object of the most research in solar array arcing.  The more destructive 
continuous arc has only been observed in the past few years as power levels have 
increased (causing higher and higher string voltages to be used).  In addition, the drive to 
ever-more-compact string layouts has resulted in some unfortunate design choices.  The 
sections that follow are therefore organized around the fast transient event.  The 
continuous arc will be addressed in the final section with a summary of what is known at 
this time.  
</p>
<p>C.1.2.1.2  Initiation Mechanism 
</p>
<p>The initiation of a solar array arc depends on the presence of a strong local electric field.  
Frequently, the source is an exposed interconnect which, depending on its location in the 
string, can be at high potential.   
 
Most problematic are arcs that initiate at triple-points.  A triple-point is a point in space 
where insulator, conductor, and plasma all meet. For a solar cell operating in LEO, this is 
usually the solar cell interconnect, but it can also be the edge of the solar cell (near the 
substrate or the coverslide).  It has been shown that arcing on solar arrays at voltages less 
negative than about -1000 V is always mediated by the presence of a plasma.  Identical 
samples to those that arced at -100 V in a plasma have been shown to withstand -1000 V 
bias in a pure vacuum.  Arcs that occur in a pure (plasma-free) vacuum are called 
“vacuum arcs.”  Succeeding paragraphs discuss theories for the triple-point arcs that 
occur only in plasmas. 
 
Arcs have been observed at relatively low potentials (as low negative as -75 V) when 
conductor surfaces are biased negative near insulator surfaces in the presence of a 
plasma.  Arc rate is strongly dependent on plasma density and on coverslide temperature, 
which affects the surface conductivity.  It can range from intermittent (on a scale of 
minutes and perhaps hours or longer) to several per second.  Arc currents observed in 
ground tests are on the order of an ampere and can last several microseconds.  These 
characteristics depend on the capacitance to space, increasing with increasing 
capacitance.  These arcs are usually associated with solar cell array interconnects, but 
have also been observed on biased conductor surfaces covered with dielectric strips.  
They are likely to be of concern whenever conducting surfaces at negative potentials with 
respect to plasma abut insulating surfaces. </p>

<p> 
Several mechanisms are proposed for initiation of the arcs.  Because much higher 
voltages are required to initiate arcs in a pure vacuum than in plasma, the plasma arc 
must not be a so-called vacuum arc, but is initiated at much lower electric field strengths.  
One favored mechanism proposes that a thin layer of relatively insulating film develops 
on the conductor.  High electric fields develop across the film, caused by ion collection 
on the exposed face.  The resulting electric field across the film causes electron emission 
from the conductor through the film into the plasma (Jongeward et al., 1985). A second, 
though perhaps related, mechanism assumes that the high electric fields at the edge of the 
dielectric cause propagation of secondary electrons to the dielectric surface from near the 
conductor-dielectric-vacuum interface.  Also, sufficiently intense electric fields can 
develop locally at the tips of structures built on the conductor surface because of the 
mobility of surface atoms driven by the electric field resulting from the presence of the 
nearby dielectric surface.  However, this “structure related” arcing requires thin whiskers 
that have not been seen on realistic samples.   Finally, gas desorbed from dielectric 
surfaces by electron impact can become ionized and serve as an ideal current path for the 
full-fledged arc. 
 
At this time, no complete theories exist for the arc mechanism on solar cell arrays in a 
plasma.  All require inclusion of an empirical factor to produce the observed low arcing 
voltage thresholds at triple-points.  Experimental evidence indicates that an electron 
emission mechanism plays an important role in producing the arcs.  A preliminary theory 
has been advanced that relates electron emission to the charging of a “dirty” layer on 
metal surfaces and the electric fields near an insulator-conductor-insulator surface 
configuration.  This theory accounts for some of the experimental observations.   
 
An electron emission mechanism for solar array arcing is consistent with several 
experimental observations.  Kennerud (1974) observed that the apparent ion collection of 
a solar cell array was enhanced by an order of magnitude prior to arcing.  This could be 
accounted for either by electron emission, or by an increase in ion density of the plasma.  
Snyder and Tyree (1984) observed this emission as an increase in electron current 
collected by sensors in the tank with the solar array.  They also noticed that these currents 
did not cease when the plasma generator was turned off.  Arcing could still occur with no 
plasma in the tank as long as these emission currents were detected.  Snyder (1984) also 
noticed that arcs did not take place in a very low-density plasma (10
</p>
<p>2
 cm
</p>
<p>-3
).   
</p>
<p> 
The occurrence of arcs can be predicted from the potential of the solar array coverslides 
relative to the plasma.  In a very low-density plasma, even at relatively high bias 
voltages, the coverslides remained near plasma ground and no arcs occurred.  At higher 
plasma densities, the coverslide potentials became several tens of volts more negative 
than plasma ground.  When this condition existed, arcs occurred.  Electrons from the 
plasma do not have enough energy to pass through the energy barrier set up by the biased 
interconnects and reach the insulator surfaces (Parks et al., 1986). Electrons emitted from 
the interconnects of the array cause the cover slides to charge negatively relative to the </p>

</p>
<p>plasma.  These observations indicate that electron emission is necessary before the 
current pulse of the arcs can occur.  Galofaro et al. (1999)  have shown that an arc is 
always preceded by a nanosecond burst of electrons from the arc site. This burst can also 
ignite arcs on nearby surfaces. 
 
Jongeward et al. (1985) proposed an arc mechanism model to account for this emission.  
The negatively biased interconnects tend to collect positive ions from the plasma.  A 
layer of relatively high resistance material several angstroms thick can collect a 
sufficiently high surface density of positive ions to permit field emission of electrons 
from the region.  This mechanism was first proposed to account for enhanced secondary 
electron yields from oxide films (Malter, 1936).  Electrons emitted from this site are 
accelerated by the electric field between the cell or interconnect and the coverglass 
surface and strike the coverglass edge, which then emits secondary electrons in a cascade.  
Adsorbed gases are desorbed by electron impact.  Ionization of these desorbed gases 
produces a dense plasma which is necessary for large currents to flow (Cho &amp; Hastings, 
1991).  Some inferences can be made that are consistent with the experimental 
observations.  There must be enough ion flux to the interconnect to maintain a high 
surface charge on the high resistance layer. The metal-insulator geometry provides a 
focusing effect which increases the ion flux to the interconnect and maintains the surface 
charge density.  Field emission accounts for the relatively steady emission, which 
probably represents a metastable situation.  The solar array arcs arise when this stability 
breaks down, producing increased electron emission.    
 
This model predicts the time duration and current of the arcs to almost a factor of two.  
Progress is also being made in predicting arc rates using this model.  For instance, Perez 
de la Cruz et al. (1996) were successful in modeling the arc rates and thresholds seen in 
the SAMPIE experiment.  The importance of adsorbed contaminants has been 
experimentally verified by Vayner et al. (2002). 
 
Brandhorst and Best (2001) have shown that solar array arcs can be initiated in the 
laboratory by simulated micrometeoroid strikes. 
</p>
<p>C.1.2.1.3  Arcing Threshold 
</p>
<p>In an attempt to consolidate all known arcing information on solar arrays, Ferguson (1986) 
has analyzed the arcing data from the Plasma Interactions Experiment II (PIX II) array and 
compared it to other ground and flight data (see figure 3).  Figure 3 is reproduced in Hastings 
(Hastings et al., 1992; Hastings, 1995) with theoretical predictions superimposed.  The 
ground and flight data reported there is from Ferguson (1986).  Ferguson’s conclusions are 
listed in a-g below.  Parenthetical material has been added to Ferguson’s original 
conclusions.

<p>a.  A threshold for arcing of 2x2 cm solar cells into the plasma appears to exist 
near -230 V (with respect to the plasma).  A threshold can exist for 5.9x5.9 cm cells at a 
lower voltage, but is not yet proved.  (More modern studies have found thresholds as low 
as -75 V for specific array designs.  The difference in threshold is more likely caused by 
coverslide thickness than cell size.) 
</p>
<p> 
b.  The arc rate at voltages above the threshold seems to be a power law of the 
</p>
<p>voltage.  This, combined with a nearly linear dependence of arc rate on plasma density, 
produces an apparent "threshold" which varies with plasma density.  (Here, “above” 
means for voltages more negative than the threshold voltage.  The apparent threshold is 
just because the “waiting time” for an arc to occur has exceeded the measurement 
interval.) 
</p>
<p> 
c.  The arc rate decreases to a steady value on a timescale of a few hours.  It is not 
</p>
<p>yet clear whether this is caused by repeated arcing or to exposure to the plasma. (Further 
studies have shown (Vayner et al., 2002; Galofaro et al., 2002) that this is caused by both 
- outgassing into the vacuum removes contaminants over time, and arcs destroy 
contaminant islands in their burst of plasma.) 
</p>
<p> 
d.  The arc rate can depend on the plasma density to the first power, on the square 
</p>
<p>root of the ion temperature, and inversely on the square root of the ion mass. (That is, on 
the ion flux onto the sample.) 
</p>
<p> 
e.  No significant dependence of the arc rate on the number of cells or 
</p>
<p>interconnects could be found in the data. (This is still the case—the most likely arc site 
goes first, but there is no dearth of other arc sites when the charge builds back up.  That 
this occurred in the data showed that each arc nearly completely discharged the available 
capacitance.  Schemes can be proposed to prevent an arc from communicating with other 
cells or strings than the one on which it occurs, but in general all electrically connected 
cells or strings will contribute capacitance-stored energy to the discharge.) 
</p>
<p> 
f.  The arc rate is greater in the flight test conditions than in ground tests, possibly 
</p>
<p>because of the atomic oxygen plasma in LEO.  (It is unclear what other differences affect 
the arc rate, although cell temperature is clearly important in subsequent flight data such 
as Photovoltaic Array Space Power Plus Diagnostics (PASP-Plus.) 
</p>
<p> 
g. The arc rate in cells with exposed conductors on the backs, as in welded-
</p>
<p>through substrates, is higher at all likely arcing voltages than the rate for cells exposed to 
the plasma only on the fronts.  (This effect could be caused by copper being exposed on 
the backs, as contrasted with silver on the fronts.) 
</p>
<p> 
Studies by Upschulte et al. (1994) and Hastings et al. (1992) confirm that a voltage 
threshold exists for solar array arcing, and for certain values of a parameter called the 
field enhancement factor (FEF) (Cho et al., 1990), reasonable values of the threshold are </p>

<p>predicted.  Vayner et al. (2001)  have shown that arcing is enhanced primarily by the 
presence of desorbing contaminant layers, although thin coverslides and other 
geometrical factors can also enhance the electric field and lower the arc threshold.  
Snyder et al. (1998) have shown that hot arrays (100o C) have a higher arc threshold than 
cool arrays (room temperature) in ground tests, presumably because the coverslides 
become more conductive at high temperatures.  These results were confirmed on orbit in 
the PASP Plus experiment for the APSA-type solar arrays (Soldi &amp; Hastings, 1995).

<p>C.1.2.1.4  Typical Waveform 
</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the time dependence of the current from an array segment during an arc 
(Snyder &amp; Tyree, 1984). A typical arcing sequence has the following four regions:  
 
</p>
<p>I. The arc is initiated and the current increases to a peak value.  The rise time 
varies from less than 0.1 µs to about 1 µs.  The peak amplitude and rise time 
depend primarily on the capacitance electrically connected to the arc site. 
</p>
<p>II. The current then remains near the peak value for some time. 
</p>
<p>III The current decreases with a roughly exponential decay.  The decay time 
associated with the termination of the arc should not be confused with the 
total duration of the arc.  During this decay the current is space-charge 
limited. 
</p>
<p>IV. The arc terminates suddenly and the array begins to recharge to the bias 
voltage.  At this point the coverslides of the array are substantially positive 
relative to both space and the arc point.  The coverslides collect a substantial 
electron current from the plasma, resulting in the observation of a slight 
negative pulse.   </p>

<p>C.1.2.1.5  System Response 
</p>
<p>Arc currents can flow out into the surrounding plasma, with the return currents 
distributed over wide areas of other spacecraft surfaces. 
 
During an arc two things will happen.  As charge leaves during an arc, the potential of the 
arc site changes and the potential of the system, electrically connected to the arc site, will 
change.  As a result of the potential change, return currents will flow to restore 
equilibrium. The return currents will come both from the surrounding plasma and from 
the arc-generated plasma. There are two impacts on other systems.  The structure currents 
will look like noise to instrumentation.  And the change in spacecraft ground will affect 
plasma currents to surfaces.  In principle, these responses are the same for transients of 
any cause:  docking, thruster firings, waste dumps, and beam experiments. Only the 
magnitudes will be different.  
 
The response of a system to an arc can be estimated from a circuit analysis including 
terms to approximate the capacitances of the surfaces to space.  An arc can be simulated </p>

<p>C.1.2.1.6  Damage Potential 
</p>
<p>Initial indications that sustained arcs could cause substantial damage to solar arrays were 
obtained in testing where the bias power supply, intended to impress a potential 
difference between an array and its coverslides, was not sufficiently isolated from the 
sample when arcs occurred (see section C.1.2.3.1).  Tests at Lewis Research Center 
(LeRC), now Glenn Research Center (GRC), in the 1980s showed that solar array 
interconnects could be melted by arc currents as large as 40 A (Miller, 1985). 
 
Although pictures of damage produced by on-orbit sustained arcs are rare because most 
arrays that have arced are not recovered, we do have photos of damage suffered by the 
European Space Agency (ESA) European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) spacecraft that 
was recovered by the Space Shuttle.  Figure 5 shows a sustained arc site on its solar 
arrays.  In this case, the sustained arc eventually burned through the array substrate to the 
grounded backing, completely shorting the array string to ground. 
 
The Space Systems Loral satellites PAS-6 and Tempo-2 underwent sustained arcing in 
GEO that led to several shorted solar array strings and a severe loss of power.  Although 
these were GEO failures, it is believed that after the initial arc occurs, the mechanism for 
sustained arcing is the same for LEO.  Subsequent SS/Loral satellites underwent 
extensive modification to prevent sustained arcing, and have had no similar string failures 
since that time.  These modifications were the following: 
</p>
<p> 
a. Changing the array layouts so that strings with high voltage differences were 
</p>
<p>not adjacent to each other.  
b. Including blocking diodes to prevent high currents from flowing during an arc. 
c. Grouting the cell edges on the strings with the highest voltage differences to 
</p>
<p>prevent arcs from being sustained between strings. 
 
A sustained arc on a test sample of arrays for the Earth Observing System – Morningside 
1 (now Terra) (EOS-AM1) satellite, was seen in laboratory testing.  Figure 6 is a frame 
from the videotape taken during the test, and figure 7 shows the vicinity of the site where 
the arc occurred.  The capacitor used in this test to start the initial arc was 5 microfarads, 
and the arc started and continued until the power supply was manually shut off seconds 
later.  The solar array string was completely shorted out.  This test led to rework of the 
entire array strings on the Terra satellite to prevent arcing on orbit.  Flat-pack blocking 
diodes were incorporated into each string to prevent high currents from flowing during an 
arc, and Kapton® tape was used to cover exposed power bus conductors.  The 
modifications made to the EOS-AM1 and SS/Loral arrays are incorporated in the 
standard above (section 4.1.5b).

The most famous sustained arc event of all led to the breakage of the TSS-1R 
electrodynamic tether, and the loss of the attached satellite.  Figure 8 shows the burned, 
frayed, and broken tether end still attached to the Shuttle after the break.  Incidentally, the 
tether continued arcing long after it and its satellite were drifting free, until finally it went 
into night conditions where the electron density was insufficient to sustain the arc.  Noel 
Sargent (2002) has investigated whether the high current and long duration TSS-1R arc 
was seen to disrupt Shuttle communications.  Although he has found no record of 
disturbed communications during the event, for most of the time, the arc was shielded by 
metallic structures from the communications antennas, and when the tether broke, the arc 
was many meters from the receiving antennas.  We do not know whether sustained arcs 
produce radio noise severe enough to be a communications problem. </p>

When the structure or array capacitance electrically connected to the arc site is 
sufficiently large, the initial transient arcs themselves can be large enough to produce 
significant damage.  Figure 9 shows an anodized aluminum plate that has undergone 
repeated arcing in the laboratory with the ISS structure capacitance attached.  Its thermal 
properties have been completely destroyed, along with most of the insulating surface 
layer of aluminum oxide.  Because it was not feasible to redesign all of the surfaces on 
ISS or all of the connections between surfaces to eliminate the enormous connected 
capacitance, a plasma contactor was baselined for ISS to prevent charging to arcing 
voltage levels.

<p>C.1.2.2  EMI 
</p>
<p>Solar array arcs typically involve the violent discharge of very large currents for very 
short times.  Not surprisingly, the electromagnetic spectrum associated with such 
discharges obeys the typical power law that has long been observed with arc discharges.  
An example of such a spectrum is shown in figure 10 (Leung, 1985).  The test article was 
a small solar array sample that was proposed for a plasma interactions experiment in the 
Space Shuttle cargo bay.  The test was designed to learn whether the radiated EMI from 
the sample would exceed orbiter specifications.  The test was done with the bare array 
alone and with an added capacitance that simulated the energy storage associated with a 
full-size array.  The biasing power supplies were electrically isolated from the arcs by a 
large resistor.  As the curves show, even arcs from a small test array exceed allowed EMI 
specifications over most of the frequency range.  It should be expected that arcing will 
always produce detectable EMI and that laboratory testing will be needed to quantify the 
level of interference.  The magnitude of radiated EMI is a strong function of the “antenna 
gain” composed of those conductive (radiating) elements connected to the arc site.  This 
effect heavily influences the shape of the radiated EMI spectrum (Sargent, 2002).  Since 
antenna gain is extremely difficult to estimate, testing is essential.

<p>C.1.2.3   Structure Arcing 
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are two forms of structure arcing.  The first is triple-point 
arcing, as has been discussed for solar arrays; and the second is dielectric breakdown.  
For triple-point arcing, an insulator must surround a highly negative conductor, and an 
arc can occur at the conductor-insulator-plasma conjunction, where the electric field is 
highest.  Dielectric breakdown is completely different, and will be discussed below. 
 
An insulator not in the wake in LEO will come through current balance to a potential 
within a few volts of the plasma potential.  If that insulator covers a conductor, the 
conductor can be at a very different potential (such as the negative floating potential of 
the spacecraft, for instance).  In this case, a thin insulator can undergo dielectric 
breakdown under the high electric field developed across it.  While this can occur for any 
type of insulator, it is of perhaps greatest interest in the case of anodized aluminum, the 
main ISS structural element, and a material used in astronaut Extra-Vehicular 
Maneuvering Unit (spacesuit) (EMUs).  Because the dielectric layer in anodized 
aluminum is typically very thin (0.1-1 mil), it can break down at potentials as small as -
100 V or less—less than the negative floating potential that is possible for a 160 V array.  
It was the arcing threat from the ISS anodized aluminum that forced ISS to incorporate 
the PCUs to control ISS floating potentials.  The PCUs act by creating a large localized 
plasma cloud that makes good electrical contact with the surrounding plasma, and 
essentially by brute force, grounds the ISS structure to the ambient plasma.   A generic 
plasma-contacting device is called a “plasma contactor.” 
 
Different samples of anodized material break down at different potentials in a plasma 
(Hillard et al., 2000). Although ISS sulfuric acid anodize withstands about -200 V before 
breaking down, the chromic acid anodize was found in ground tests to break down at about 
-72 V.  Most disturbing of all, chromic acid anodized samples for astronaut EMUs were 
found to break down at potentials of only –60 V, relative to the plasma, with a two-sigma 
error bar of 10 V.  It is thus possible that an astronaut, grounded to ISS by his tether or 
conductive tools, could undergo an arc at only –50 V.  A sneak circuit analysis showed that 
such arcs could put &gt; 40 milliamps of current through an astronaut’s heart (Koontz, 2005).  
Since this amount is enough to cause heart stoppage, it is imperative that, if the ISS plasma 
contactors are inoperable during astronaut Extra-Vehicular Activities (spacewalks) EVAs, 
a method be used to prevent ISS astronaut workplaces from floating more than 50 V 
negative. 
 
Dielectric breakdown currents will essentially discharge all surfaces close enough (about 
2 meters or so) for the induced plasma cloud to reach.  For thin dielectric layers, a few 
square meters of surface are effectively a capacitor of many microfarads, and can hold 
several joules of energy, all of which can be discharged in the arc.  For many ISS 
surfaces, peak arc strengths of hundreds of amps have been calculated.  Arcs this strong 
will melt the arc site and spew molten metal through space.  Plasma chamber tests of this </p>

</p>
<p>kind of arcing are spectacular indeed!  Arcs on one anodized surface have been seen to 
trigger arcs on nearby line-of-sight surfaces (sympathetic arcs; see Vayner et al., 1998). 
 
Very thin dielectric layers will have a low enough resistance that for the purposes of the 
plasma, they would collect current rather than building it up on their surfaces.  Thus, 
while mitigating dielectric breakdown, they must be considered as conductors rather than 
insulators. 
 
Predicting arc thresholds for thin insulating layers is not as simple as using the published 
dielectric strengths for insulating materials.  It has been found that identical thicknesses 
of the same anodization can differ by a factor of three or more in arc threshold voltage in 
a plasma.  This can be caused by differences in sealing the anodize surfaces, which could 
affect their resistance to plasma currents.  Until the theoretical situation is better 
understood, plasma testing must be used to determine the dielectric strength of insulators 
in applications, which could lead to charging in LEO (Hillard et al., 2000).  
 
Carruth et al. (2001) have found that dielectric breakdown can also be initiated by 
simulated micrometeoroid strikes at voltages as low as -75 V.  In tests at the Glenn 
Research Center, anodized aluminum plates were seen to breakdown in a simulated space 
plasma at voltages as low as -55 V (Galofaro et al., 1999). 
</p>
<p>C.1.2.3.1  The Continuous Arc (Sustained Arc) 
</p>
<p>Arcs that occur in air when electrical contacts are made or broken are caused by 
breakdown of the neutral gas (Paschen discharge).  Although these can become 
continuous (“showering arcs”), they are not the same phenomenon as the continuous arcs 
in a LEO environment, which involve breakdown of the gas liberated by the arc itself.  
[See Holm (1999) for a discussion of continuous arcs in air.]. 
 
When the LEO arc circuit includes the solar arrays, distribution cabling, or other source 
of power, it can be possible for structure or solar array arcs to become continuous (or 
sustained).  Such continuous arcs, fed by the power supply, have an essentially 
inexhaustible source of energy and can lead to catastrophic damage.  This hypothesis for 
the loss of solar array strings on the SS/Loral satellites PAS-6 and Tempo II was 
confirmed by ground tests done by Snyder et al. (2000).  Later testing on the EOS-AM1 
arrays showed that continuous solar array arcs could occur in a LEO environment at a 
string voltage as low as 100-120 V.  (In those tests, the sustained arc occurred at a 
voltage relative to the surrounding plasma of   –250 V.)  The most recent data (Vayner et 
al., 2003) has shown that strings with potentials as low as 40 V with respect to each other 
can lead to sustained arcing.  The scenario for the catastrophic loss is given in Ferguson 
et al. (1999), and is summarized here as follows: 
 
First, an ordinary solar array arc must get started, usually at a triple-point as described 
above.  In the case of the SS/Loral arrays, the differential voltage between solar array and </p>

</p>
<p>plasma could have been as low as 100 V, since the SS/Loral arrays were using thin 
coverslides similar to the APSA cells, which arced at voltages as low as -75 V on orbit.  
See the PASP Plus results in Soldi and Hastings (1995). 
 
When the initial arc (sometimes called the primary or trigger arc) is generated, it 
discharges only the local capacitance, but the arc plasma expands out from the arc site 
and comes in contact with an exposed conductor at a very different voltage.  In the case 
of the SS/Loral arrays, the most positive end of the array strings was less than a 
millimeter away from the negative end.  Now the arc plasma makes direct contact with 
the other conductor and makes for an almost dead short to that spot.  The arc current has 
changed from one that is discharging capacitance to a current between two ends of the 
solar array string. 
 
If the current available to the arc site from the functioning array is greater than a certain 
threshold value (believed to be about ½ amp for some array designs) and the voltage 
between strings is above a certain value (believed to be about 40 V for some array 
designs), the arc can become continuous.  In ground tests these arcs continued until the 
source of power was artificially turned off.  In space, the arc would presumably continue 
until the exposed conductors were melted through and the circuit was thereby interrupted.  
This process could take seconds or minutes.  Ground tests have shown that an arc that 
persists for more than a few hundred microseconds will not shut off by itself. 
 
An arc that lasts long enough will locally heat the substrate and release gases.  In the case 
of a Kapton® substrate, the Kapton® chars, but the char is also a good conductor, 
providing a path for the arc to continue.  Snyder et al. (2000) have shown that the heat 
generated in continuous arcs on Kapton® is sufficient to produce the Kapton® charring 
measured after the event. 
 
In any event, a continuous arc can destroy a whole string (if the arc is between traces on 
the same string) or adjacent strings (if the arc is between strings) or the entire array power 
(if the arc is between combined power traces).  The possibility of losing the entire array 
power on the Deep Space 1 mission caused the builders to remove a solar panel that had 
already been installed to modify it and its sister array to prevent continuous arcing.  Its 
power traces were only a few millimeters apart, and were exposed both to the plasma and 
to each other before the modifications were made.  Afterwards, insulating material was 
used to prevent arc plasma from shorting out between the power traces. 
 
Anodized aluminum structure elements can be subject to continuous arcing if the arc 
plasma generated can contact the solar array or other power source or if the potential at 
the arc site can be maintained at a high enough negative level by a high voltage electron-
collecting power source.  Such continuous anodized breakdowns were called “sizzle arcs” 
by the team that discovered them (Murphy et al., 1992).

</p>
<p>Finally, an arc on an electrodynamic tether can become continuous.  The infamous arc on 
the TSS-1R tether that led to its break and the loss of the satellite was a continuous 
(sustained) arc with its power supplied by the tether.  The arc site was a flaw in the tether 
insulation that spewed out gas, which became ionized and completed the arc circuit path 
(Szalai et al., 1996; Vaughn et al., 1997).  Since in this case the power source was more 
one of constant voltage rather than constant current, the 3500 volt potential difference 
between the tether top and bottom caused the arc site to float at just the negative potential 
(about –600 V) necessary to keep the arc going and still collect the ~1 ampere arc current 
of electrons on the satellite.  Had TSS-1R used a tether of greater resistance, the threshold 
arc current could not have been maintained.  For example, a total tether resistance of 
10,000 ohms would have limited the arc current to less than 0.4 amps, less than the 
sustained arc threshold.  As an alternative, if the satellite electron collection capability 
had been limited to less than about ½ amp, the arc could not have been sustained.  Of 
course, these measures would have severely restricted the power or propulsion that could 
be obtained by tether operation and could not be tolerated on an experiment that was not 
just a proof-of-concept.  An arc detection circuit could have also been used to shut the 
tether down at the satellite end when very large currents were first detected.  One should 
never assume that a high voltage power system will not arc.

<p>APPENDIX D 
MITIGATION TECHNIQUES 
</p>
<p>D.1 Current Collection 
</p>
<p>If a spacecraft has no exposed high voltage conductors, it will not collect much current.  
That is, insulation or encapsulation is a valid technique for preventing current collection 
in LEO.  The GEO Spacecraft Charging Guidelines (Purvis et al., 1984) recommend 
coating spacecraft surfaces with conducting materials to keep all surface potentials the 
same and reduce differential charging.  In LEO, however, the space plasma will act to 
keep insulating surfaces at the same potential (discounting wake effects), so conductive 
coatings are not needed.  If encapsulation or insulation is not possible, hiding conductive 
surfaces (like the edges of solar cells) from the ambient plasma by use of narrow spacing 
of overlying insulators (like coverslides) can choke off most current collection.  It has 
often been remarked that if the ISS solar arrays had just a little more coverslide overhang 
and/or a little tighter cell spacing, the issue with ISS charging would not have occurred.  
Of course, if all high voltage components are inside a sealed pressure vessel, they cannot 
collect current from the ambient plasma. 
 
Encapsulation, or grouting with Room Temperature Vulcanized-rubber  
(RTV), of solar arrays has been shown to be an effective method to prevent electron 
collection and charging (Reed et al., 2001).  Of course, the grout must be UV and AO 
resistant.  Care must be taken in the use of encapsulants, however, when the possibility 
exists of outgassing in the presence of high voltage components.  For instance, on 
SAMPIE, one of the high voltage power supplies was destroyed by a Paschen discharge 
that occurred on a high voltage component where the encapsulant had delaminated and a 
neutral pressure was enclosed with the high voltage component (Ferguson &amp; 
Hillard,1997).  (See figure 11 for Paschen curves.)  On TSS-1R, the “trigger arc” was a 
Paschen discharge due to entrained gas inside the tether pulley casings (Szalai et al., 
1996; Vaughn et al., 1997). In this case, a flaw in its insulation exposed the tether 
conductor. 
 
Placing plasma-current-collecting conductors into the wake of a large spacecraft is an 
effective technique for preventing current collection.  On ISS, for instance, FPP data 
showed that when the arrays were turned into their own wakes, they collected such a 
small amount of electron current that the ISS structure would not charge.  On ISS, this 
technique of wake-pointing the arrays is now used as a backup for the Plasma Contacting 
Units during astronaut EVAs.  Of course, very high potentials on wake-pointing 
conductors can collapse the wake, but this will require thousands of volts potential for 
large structures. 
 
For a spacecraft that will often undergo auroral passage, one must be careful with the use 
of insulators.  Like in GEO, spacecraft in the aurorae can undergo rapid differential </p>

<p>D.2 Controlling Spacecraft Potential 
</p>
<p>There are three basic techniques to control spacecraft potential.  One is to place the 
structure at the most positive potential generated by the LEO spacecraft power system 
(the positive ground option).  The second is to ground the structure by brute force to the 
ambient plasma (the plasma contactor solution).  The third is to prevent any plasma 
exposure of high voltage conducting surfaces (the encapsulation solution).  These </p>

</p>
<p>65 of 82 
</p>
<p>mitigation strategies are discussed in order below.  For ideas about other ways to prevent 
spacecraft charging, see Ferguson (2002).  
</p>
<p>D.2.1 Positive Ground 
</p>
<p>Since charging in LEO is dominated by current collection on the most positive end of the 
solar arrays, and the negative end floats at about 90 percent (typically) of the string 
voltage, the positive end of the array will be about 10 percent of the array string voltage 
away from the plasma potential.  For a 160 V array, this means a positively grounded 
structure will float at 16 V or less away from the plasma potential.  Most deleterious 
plasma effects are minimal at such a potential.  In fact, the structure in this case 
contributes to electron collection, and actually floats closer to plasma potential than the 
positive end of the array does, taken alone, because of exposed grounded conductors on 
the structure. 
 
However, most spacecraft power systems are negatively grounded because of a dearth of 
space-qualified electronics with the positive ground polarity.  Although very efficient 
PMAD systems now exist that use buck-boost converters to change the ground polarity 
and voltage (Button et al., 2002), most spacecraft busses do not incorporate this 
technology yet. 
 
For instance, when ISS charging possibilities were first being considered, it was 
estimated that to change the power system ground from negative to positive would cost at 
least $100 M.  It was decided instead to use the plasma contactor mitigation strategy 
detailed below, which ended up costing less than $35 M. 
 
A variant of this technique uses a center-tapped array, but will only cut the maximum 
structure potential to about half the solar array string voltage.  Grounding the power 
system at about 90 percent of its maximum positive voltage would be nearly ideal, since 
it should place the spacecraft ground at near the plasma potential. 
</p>
<p>D.2.2 Plasma Contactors 
</p>
<p>A device that makes good contact with the surrounding plasma can effectively ground its 
point of contact.  If the device is a large sheet of metal, it will dominate current collection 
and stay near plasma potential.  However, the sheet of conductor must be much larger 
than the solar array effective electron-collecting area for this solution to work.  In the 
case of ISS for instance, the metal sheet would need hundreds or thousands of square 
meters of ram ion collecting area to be effective.  In LEO, the drag produced by such a 
large area would be prohibitive. 
 
Electron guns were used on PIX-II1  and PASP Plus (Guidice et al., 1997) to emit the 
electrons being collected by high voltage solar arrays and thus prevent charging, but such 
devices are limited by space charge considerations to low emitted electron currents.  A </p>

</p>
<p>66 of 82 
</p>
<p>better solution is a device that is not limited by space charge considerations, i.e., a plasma 
contactor. 
 
A plasma contactor generates a high-density plasma cloud, which expands and makes 
good electrical contact with the ambient plasma.  Usually a hollow cathode device is used 
to emit a xenon plasma (Davis et al., 1986) whose space charge is nullified by nearly 
equal densities of electrons and ions in the emitted cloud.  The very mobile electrons 
carry current into the surrounding ambient plasma.  This current can be very large.  For 
instance, the ISS PCU device has a hollow cathode element smaller than a little finger, 
but can emit up to 10 amps of continuous electron current.  In the case of ISS, the PCU 
acts like a ground rod at its location to effectively ground (to within about 20 V) the 
structure to the ambient plasma.  Of course, at other points, the structure will still have 
the lv
</p>
<p>ρρρ
•× B  potential away from the ambient plasma.  In LEO, lv
</p>
<p>ρρρ
•× B  amounts to a 
</p>
<p>maximum of only about 1/3 V per meter, which  is only about 40 V from end to end on 
the largest structure ever orbited (ISS), so at all points the potential is outside the arcing 
range (- 50 V or less). 
 
While a hollow cathode plasma contactor requires xenon gas vessels, refurbishment, etc., 
other devices with little or no expellant are being explored for use as plasma contactors.   
As an example, a plasma contactor made of microtips and microscopic holes, with an 
imposed bias, could theoretically emit electrons over a wide area and thus defeat the 
space charge limitation with no working gas.  A patent has been awarded for using such a 
device to control spacecraft potentials in GEO (Katz, 2001), but making such a device 
work reliably in the high density plasma of LEO is no small feat and has not yet been 
done.  
</p>
<p>D.2.3 Encapsulation  
</p>
<p>Encapsulating the high voltage conductors on solar arrays, etc., can have a two-fold 
beneficial effect.  First, it can prevent arcing at triple-points by keeping the plasma away 
from the conductor-insulator junctions.  Second, it can prevent electron collection by the 
arrays, and thus prevent spacecraft charging at its root cause.  As of the year 2002, the only 
arrays ground tested in a simulated LEO plasma to withstand bias voltages greater than -300 
V were those with the arrays or cells encapsulated (Reed et al., 2001; Brandhorst &amp; Best, 
2001; Ferguson et al., 2002).  Since that time, other mitigation techniques have extended the 
arcing threshold to at least -500 V, but no arrays with unmitigated arcing have withstood 
more than -300 V to date. 
 
When encapsulating arrays or cells, one must not ignore several caveats.  First, no air 
must be entrained anywhere.  While this seems obvious, at least one set of encapsulated 
test arrays sent to NASA’s Glenn Research Center had sufficient air entrained that the 
coating delaminated and swelled under vacuum.  In fact, so much air was entrained that 
the test articles under vacuum appeared to swell up like plastic balloons.  In cases where </p>

</p>
<p>67 of 82 
</p>
<p>only a very small amount of air is trapped, visible effects may not occur, yet the trapped 
air will present the danger of Paschen breakdown under high voltage (see figure 11). 
 
Second, the encapsulant thickness must be sufficient to withstand dielectric breakdown at 
the highest array voltage.  For thin-film arrays, this consideration can contribute 
significantly to the array mass.  In keeping with the discussion on structure arcing, it is 
important that thin-film encapsulants be tested under voltage in a plasma environment, 
rather than relying solely on published dielectric strengths. 
 
Third, the encapsulant must not be able to peel away from high voltage components, or 
Paschen breakdown can occur because of entrained outgassing products that can reach 
sufficiently high neutral pressures.  Figure 11 shows the Paschen breakdown curve for a 
number of gases for DC to low frequency AC (~ 400 Hz) for parallel plates (Dunbar, 
1988).  Here it can be seen that for a wide range of pressure distance combinations, the 
Paschen minima are typically around a few hundred volts for common gases.  Helium gas 
has the lowest Paschen minimum voltage.  Most outgassing products have not had their 
Paschen curves measured.  In the case of solar arrays, a coverglass that covers many cells 
must also make allowances for escape of outgassing products from adhesives.  It must be 
treated for all intents and purposes as a vented enclosure (discussed below). 
 
Fourth, the encapsulant must be able to withstand other aspects of the space environment 
for its design lifetime.  Atomic oxygen, micrometeoroids and debris, and UV and X-ray 
exposure are some of the threats to the encapsulant.  Glass stands up well to all of these 
environments.  Some plastics do not. 
</p>
<p>D.2.3.1  Vented Enclosures 
</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the use of a sealed pressure vessel eliminates environmental 
interactions and this applies to plasma interactions as well.  In the more general case, 
high voltage systems other than solar arrays are usually contained in a vented enclosure. 
To avoid plasma interactions, care must be taken that plasma does not enter the enclosure 
and react with exposed conductors inside.  The key requirement on such systems is that 
all openings must be smaller than the plasma Debye length, which depends on the plasma 
density and temperature.  One can readily estimate the maximum opening consistent with 
such a requirement. 
 
The plasma will be capable of maintaining electric fields over a distance of 
approximately one Debye length λD, which is given by  
 
λD =  (kTe/4πne2)1/2  =  7.43 x 10

<p>of 4x106 cm-3, one finds a minimum Debye length from 0.12 cm at 0.1 eV to 0.17 cm at 
0.2 eV.   
 
Openings in the experiment electronics enclosure must have smaller dimensions than this 
minimum to prohibit plasma interactions with the experiment electronics.  Larger 
openings can be used if covered with an electrically connected conductive wire mesh of 
spacing less than the minimum Debye length.  To provide a reasonable margin of safety, 
a general guideline is that no opening should exceed 0.10 cm in its largest dimension. 
 
D.2.4 Arcing 
</p>
<p>D.2.4.1 On-Orbit Arc Detection  
</p>
<p>Usually in ground tests of solar arrays under simulated LEO plasma conditions, and 
especially when the array can undergo sustained arcing, an arc detection circuit is 
employed.  It essentially looks for a rapid positive change of the array or arc site potential 
toward the plasma potential, since this must happen when electrons are emitted during an 
arc.  For example, a coil can be placed around the solar array string output wire, and 
changes in the coil current will indicate a transient in the line. Conversely, one can sense 
the emission of copious electrons and use this for arc detection.  Further, the broadband 
EMI from an arc can be used for arc detection.  On PASP-Plus, EMI detectors were used 
to determine when and where arcs occurred on-orbit.  In any event, electrical detection 
techniques can unambiguously detect an arc when it occurs.  Then, in ground tests, the 
power supply is electrically disconnected from the array, to prevent the occurrence of 
sustained arcs that might damage or destroy the sample.  Sometimes, the power supply is 
only disconnected when the arc continues for longer than 200 ms, for example, so that 
arcs that would be permanently sustained can be counted, but are not allowed to wreak 
their damage on the sample.  Such arc detection and array protection circuits can be built 
and used on solar arrays operating on orbit.  If this is done, rather than totally preventing 
arcs, the damage to the arc site is limited or prevented.  In this way, the arcs that do occur 
become acceptable. 
 
It must be obvious that the power to the LEO spacecraft will be interrupted whenever the 
array arc-circuit is broken.  Rather than being the first line of defense against arcing, arc 
detection and array shunting must only be used when the disruptions they cause will be 
infrequent. 
</p>
<p>D.2.4.2  Prevention Techniques 
</p>
<p>The design of a solar array must consider the plasma environment and interactions with 
that environment.  Arc prevention is extremely important.  The following techniques have 
been shown in ground and flight tests to prevent arcs or minimize their damage:

<p>a. If possible, use array string voltages of less than 55 V.  No trigger arcs have 
been seen on LEO arrays of less than about 55 V string voltage or on anodized aluminum 
even under simulated micrometeoroid bombardment.  Solar arrays coming out of eclipse 
will generate more voltage than when they operate at their max power point.

that no two adjacent cells have a voltage difference of greater than 40 V.  Sometimes a 
leapfrog arrangement will be sufficient.  In other high voltage arrays, the strings should 
be arranged parallel to each other.  Serpentine strings can be used to prevent the array 
width from becoming prohibitive.  If the string layout cannot be modified to prevent cells 
with more than 40 V difference being adjacent to each other (anything less than about 1 
cm can be considered adjacent), then the total string voltage must be kept low enough 
that the initial (trigger) arcs do not take place.  The lowest known array trigger arcing has 
occurred on thin-coverglass cells at about 75 volts (PASP Plus results) (Soldi &amp; Hastings, 
1995).  
</p>
<p> 
c. For array string voltages greater than about 75 V, trigger arcs in LEO can  be 
</p>
<p>completely prevented by encapsulating the cell or array edges so they do not see the 
ambient plasma.  The caveats mentioned above under “Encapsulation,” in appendix D, 
section D.2.3, must be followed.  If encapsulation is not possible, a thorough array 
bakeout on orbit (1 week at 100 C or more) can get rid of contaminants and prevent 
trigger arcing up to about -300 V, or possibly more (see Vayner et al., 2002).  Re-
contamination can occur on “dirty” spacecraft (spacecraft with excessive venting, cold 
gas nozzles, etc.).  Good encapsulation can prevent arcing up to 1000 V string voltage. 
</p>
<p>d. Sustained (or continuous) arcs can occur whenever trigger arcs occur and 
adjacent cells have more than 40 V potential differences.  However, sustained arcs, in 
addition to this voltage threshold, have a current threshold below which they will not 
occur.  It is believed that the current threshold is greater than about 0.5 amp.  If the 
current produced by each cell is above this threshold, a single string can sustain arcs.  If 
each cell is below this current threshold, then isolating separate strings of solar cells from 
each other will prevent other strings from “feeding” the arc site, and will prevent 
sustained arcs.  This isolation can be achieved by using blocking diodes in each string.  
EOS-AM1, now called Terra, is an example (Snyder et al., 2000).  Care must be taken 
that the power bus and/or other components do not have the conditions necessary for 
sustained arcing.  On the Terra arrays, for instance, it was found that diodes used to block 
interstring currents did not prevent the bus power traces from having sustained arcing 
events.  Covering all exposed bus conductors with Kapton® insulation finally solved the 
problem.  Low-outgassing RTV can be used to cover bare conductors as well. 
</p>
<p>e. RTV grout between adjacent solar cells and strings that have a high voltage 
with respect to each other has been shown to effectively block sustained arcs between 
cells and strings.  The degree of coverage, etc., is important in determining the final 
voltage threshold for sustained arcing.  </p>

<p>f. Arrays of 300 V and greater string voltage must be fully encapsulated in order 
to prevent arcing.  Caveats involved under “Encapsulation” in appendix D, section D.2.3, 
must be followed. 
</p>
<p>g. Finally, although design and construction are important in preventing trigger 
arcs and sustained arcs, each new solar array design implementation must be verified by 
testing in a simulated LEO plasma chamber before it can be sure not to arc.  This is a 
critical step.  The test bias voltage relative to the plasma should include the maximum 
array voltage when the arrays exit eclipse (or the highest floating potential expected on 
the spacecraft chassis).  The interstring voltage should be at least as great as that expected 
anywhere on the solar arrays on orbit.  A test should be conducted at the low 
temperatures experienced at eclipse exit.

<p>APPENDIX E 
MODELING 
</p>
<p>E.1 Spacecraft Charging 
</p>
<p>The severity and widespread nature of plasma interactions have led to a considerable 
investment in the development of computer models.  Many empirical and semi-empirical 
models are available with varying levels of capability and fidelity.  Since the physics of 
current collection is fully embodied in Poisson’s equation, a first-principles treatment is 
both possible and practical.  The most comprehensive such code that is available at this 
time for LEO is NASCAP/LEO (NASA Charging Analyzer Program/Low Earth Orbit).  
This code was developed as a follow-on to the original NASCAP computer program that 
dealt with spacecraft charging in geosynchronous orbit (Katz et al., 1981; Mandell et al., 
1981; Rubin &amp; Stevens, 1983). 
 
A finite element-based solver, NASCAP/LEO, reasonably approximates the geometry of 
sophisticated satellites or subsystems.  With an expandable materials database, it 
iteratively solves the potentials on all surfaces and electric fields in nearby space.  The 
existing code was designed for mainframe and workstation deployment, makes many 
approximations necessitated by the limited desktop computing power of the mid 1980s, 
and has a reputation for having a steep learning curve.  It is nevertheless credited with 
considerable success and, in the hands of a skilled user, is powerful and reliable.   
 
A new version, currently being developed in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force, called 
NASCAP-2K, is now available.  NASCAP-2K incorporates lessons learned over the past 
18 years, takes full advantage of modern computing power with much more sophisticated 
algorithms, and is designed for easier use.  Capable of modeling current collection and 
charging under LEO, GEO and auroral conditions, NASCAP-2K should now supersede 
both NASCAP and NASCAP/LEO (Neergaard et al., 2001). 
 
Of special interest here is a computer-modeling tool called EWB (Environmental 
WorkBench) (Chock &amp; Ferguson, 1997).  This tool, which can run on a desktop or laptop 
personal computer (PC), uses simple models of plasma environments and interactions to 
predict LEO spacecraft floating potentials, for example.  Over 100 models of the LEO 
environment are included in this integrated code, and over 50 interactions models, 
including the plasma interactions models considered here.  EWB was extensively funded 
by the ISS and is the official ISS plasma interactions tool.  Detailed and extensive models 
of various ISS configurations are included with EWB, although the code can also be used 
to create and model a wide variety of different LEO spacecraft.  Both EWB and NASCAP-
2K are subject to International Traffic-in-Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions, and at 
present cannot be given to non-US citizens.  For more information on distribution of these 
codes, please see http://see.msfc.nasa.gov.  European spacecraft charging modeling codes </p>

<p>Figure 12 shows a plot with the result of an EWB calculation of potentials on the ISS 
mission build 12A.  Here, a special model of ISS solar array current collection and ISS 
solar array mast wire current collection, based on PCU measurements of previous ISS 
mission builds, was constructed by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  
The potentials shown were determined by iteration until the current balance equation was 
satisfied for ISS as a whole.  In this figure, the PCUs were turned off to investigate 
charging under PCU failure conditions.  It is clear that for this configuration, most of the 
vehicle charging is due to lv

<p>Not shown are the EWB screens that detail the potentials and currents on each ISS 
component.  EWB can also easily calculate the time dependence of all of the ISS potentials 
during an orbit and their dependencies on plasma parameters and changes in the detailed 
ISS configuration.  Of course, EWB can also be used for other spacecraft.  Figure 12 
illustrates only how complex a system can be analyzed with this extremely useful computer 
code. </p>

<p>The process of electrical breakdown has not lent itself well to modeling, and solar arrays

<p>fund theoretical work in this area during the 1990s, no reliable model for arc initiation 
exists.  Experience has shown that knowledge of the potential distribution is at best a 
rough indicator of the probability of an arc.  The complex geometries involved in cell 
construction and string layout along with the poorly understood properties of adhesives, 
coatings, and other materials often result in laboratory tests’ behaving in unexpected 
ways.  This emphasizes the need for testing of solar arrays in suitable space 
environmental chambers and ultimately as part of space experiments.

<p>APPENDIX F 
TESTING 
</p>
<p> 
The importance of testing in mitigating LEO spacecraft charging and its effects cannot be 
overestimated (Ferguson, 1996). A valid LEO arc test must take place in a vacuum of 
pressure less than about 250 microtorr.  It must generate a plasma with an electron density of 
more than 105 electrons per cubic centimeter.  The electron temperature should be less than 
about 3 eV but the lower the better, and the plasma should not be a streaming plasma (it 
should be essentially isotropic) unless special diagnostic techniques are used to determine the 
plasma properties.  The sample temperature must be as low as the lowest sunlit temperature 
on orbit.  To ensure that arcs will not occur in space, a sufficiently long waiting time must be 
used at each bias voltage that the arc rate is measured to be statistically significantly lower 
than the threshold arc rate.  If the threshold is unknown, see Ferguson (1986) for a proper 
technique for establishing it in ground tests.  Be aware that the arc rate at a given voltage 
usually decreases with time in the plasma; do not confuse this with an increasing arc voltage 
threshold (Ferguson, 1986).  The chamber used for the tests should be big enough that the 
plasma sheath of the biased sample does not reach the chamber walls.  Finally, use solar 
array design and building techniques that have been space qualified, whenever possible. 
 
In LEO plasma testing, the array or anodized aluminum potential relative to the plasma 
(which in space is caused by spacecraft charging) is usually obtained by biasing the sample 
with a DC power supply.  To investigate transient arcs, one must decouple the DC power 
supply from the arc current during an arc.  This means the bias supply circuit must have a 
time constant greater than a few hundred microseconds, so the arc can build up and dissipate 
without being powered by the bias supply.  This can be done by putting a large resistance in 
the arc circuit, and incorporating a capacitor to simulate the array or structure capacitance 
that would be discharged in the arc.  For instance, if the on-orbit capacitance connected to the 
arc site is expected to be 0.1 microfarad, then this value capacitor can be used to provide 
current during the arc.  With such a capacitor, the bias supply circuit can be given a 1-
millisecond RC time constant (much greater than the arc time scale) with the use of a 10 kΩ 
series resistance.  This effectively decouples the bias power supply from the arc.  Of course, 
it also puts an upper limit on the arc rate attainable, because of recharge time considerations. 
 
In non-destructive sustained arc testing, the series resistance should be adjusted to limit the 
maximum current to that expected in the arc, and a cutoff circuit should be employed to shut 
off the bias supply after a few hundred microseconds.  Experience shows that an arc that 
continues under such circumstances for more than about 200 microseconds will be sustained.  
Arc current and/or voltage waveforms should be closely monitored to distinguish between 
transient and sustained arcs.  Videotapes of arc locations are helpful for diagnostic purposes.  
If destructive sustained arcs are allowed to occur, the videotape can confirm the arc time 
duration.
