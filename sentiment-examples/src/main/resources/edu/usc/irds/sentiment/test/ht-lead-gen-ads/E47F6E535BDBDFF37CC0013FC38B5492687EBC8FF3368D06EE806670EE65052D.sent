You spotted me from across the room and offered to buy me a drink. As I sip your ice breaker we talk a bit, laugh a littlebut were both keenly aware of the real reason continuing the conversation. Eventually, whats unspoken has been ratcheted up to an immediate desire and I ask you back to my place. Once there things escalate rapidly, were both hot and heavy. You cup my breast in your hand and then reach for what youve been waiting for down below but I push you away. You have no idea whats between my legs. Yet, as I push you down on the bed in the dimly lit room you can see what arousal does to the silhouette of my body. As I climb on to the bed I grab the back of your head and make you take all of me. You resist at first, moaning and telling me to stop but you soon find yourself loving every inch of whats filling your throat and your thoughts. Theres no going back now, I have you in the palm of my hand...
