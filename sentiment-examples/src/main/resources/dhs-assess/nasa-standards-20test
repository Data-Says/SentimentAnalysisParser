This standard defines the methodologies, practices, and requirements for the conduct of load analyses for payloads and spacecraft.  1.2  Purpose.  This standard establishes general NASA policies for the definition of loads to be used in the design and development of payloads and spacecraft.  Guidelines are prescribed to establish consistent practices and facilitate integration at the project and program levels.  Payloads and spacecraft shall be designed to maintain structural integrity and the required degree of functionality to ensure successful operation during all phases of the expected life cycle.  Flight structures and systems shall consider static and dynamic load environments to be encountered during assembly, testing, transportation, launch, ascent, space operations, extraterrestrial operations, descent, and landing.  1.3  Applicability.  This standard recommends engineering practices for NASA programs and projects.  It may be cited in contracts and program documents as a technical requirement or as a reference for guidance.  Determining the suitability of this standard and its provisions is the responsibility of program/project management and the performing organization.  Individual provisions of this standard may be tailored (i.e., modified or deleted) by contract or program specifications to meet specific program/project needs and constraints.
The objective of this NASA Technical Standard is to provide a consistent  methodology for developing pyroshock test criteria for NASA spacecraft, payload, and launch  vehicle hardware during the development, qualification, flight acceptance, and/or protoflight test  phases of the verification process.  Various aspects of pyroshock testing are discussed herein,  including test environments, methods and facilities, test margins and number of exposures,  control tolerances (when applicable), data acquisition and analysis, test tailoring, dynamic  analysis, and prediction techniques for pyroshock environments.     1.2 Applicability.  This Standard recommends engineering practices for NASA programs  and projects.  It may be cited in contracts and program documents as a technical requirement or  as a reference for guidance.  Determining the suitability of this Standard and its provisions is the  responsibility of program/project management and the performing organization.  Individual  provisions of this Standard may be tailored (i.e., modified or deleted) by contract or specification  to meet specific program/project needs and constraints.     1.3 Background     1.3.1  Pyrotechnic applications.  Current launch vehicle, payload and spacecraft designs  often utilize numerous pyrotechnic devices over the course of their missions.  These devices  are generally used to separate structural subsystems (e.g., payloads from launch vehicles),  deploy appendages (e.g., solar panels), and/or activate on-board operational subsystems (e.g.,  propellant valves).     1.3.2  Pyroshock characteristics.  Pyroshock is often characterized by its high peak  acceleration (up to 300,000 g), high frequency content (up to 1 MHz), and short duration (less  than 20 ms), which is largely dependent on the source type and size or strength, intervening  structural path characteristics (including structural type and configuration, joints, fasteners and  other discontinuities) and distance from the source to the response point of interest.  Because of  the high frequency content, many hardware elements and small components are susceptible to  pyroshock failure while resistant to a variety of lower frequency environments, including random  vibration.  High frequencies may make analytical methods and computational procedures  inapplicable for system verification under pyroshock loading.  Thus, pyroshock verification  should be accomplished experimentally, and pyroshock testing is considered essential to  mission success.     1.3.3  Potential hardware effects.  Many flight hardware failures have been attributed to  pyroshock exposure, some resulting in catastrophic mission loss [5].  Specific examples of  pyroshock failures include cracks and fractures in crystals, ceramics, epoxies, glass envelopes,  solder joints and wire leads, seal failure, migration of contaminating particles, relay and switch  chatter and transfer, and deformation of very small lightweight structural elements, such as  microelectronics.  On the other hand, deformation or failure of major structural elements is rare  except in those regions close to the source where structural failure is intended.    1    NASA-STD-7003  May 18, 1999    1.4 Summary of pyroshock environmental categories.  In this Standard, the pyroshock  environment has been divided into the following three categories, depending on the shock  severity and frequency range:  (a) near-field, (b) mid-field, and (c) far-field.  Detailed definitions  are provided in Section 3.2.3.  The intent of this categorization is to assist hardware and test  personnel in the selection of appropriate test techniques and facilities.  For the near-field, only  pyrotechnic devices should be used.  For the mid-field, either mechanical impact or pyrotechnic  devices should be used.  For the far-field, electrodynamic shakers, impact or pyrotechnic  devices may be used.     1.5 Summary of pyroshock test criteria.  Specific pyroshock test requirements are  selected based on:  (a) the flight or service pyroshock environment as defined in Section 3.2.3;  (b) the environment test categories described in Section 3.2.5; (c) the level of assembly defined  in Section 3.2.6; (d) the maximum expected flight environment as specified in Section 4.2; (e)  test margins as discussed in Section 4.3; (f) test specifications described in Section 4.4; and (g)  the test method and facility as outlined in Section 4.5.
1.1 Purpose    This Standard establishes top-level requirements and guidance for design and fabrication of  ground support equipment (GSE) to assist National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) space flight programs/projects in providing robust, safe, reliable, maintainable,  supportable, and cost-effective GSE.    1.2 Applicability     a. The application of this Standard to NASA space flight programs is at the discretion of  the program.  This Standard recommends a set of GSE design requirements for NASA programs  and projects.  This Standard is intended for use in establishing uniform engineering practices and  methods and ensuring that essential requirements are included in the design, procurement, and  fabrication of GSE used to support the operations of receiving, transportation, handling,  assembly, inspection, test, checkout, service, launch, and recovery of space vehicles and  payloads at NASA’s launch, landing, or retrieval locations.     b. This Standard is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers, including   Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers, and may be cited in contract,  program, and other Agency documents as a technical requirement.  This Standard may also apply to  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory or to contractors, grant recipients, or parties to agreements only to the  extent specified or referenced in their contracts, grants, or agreements.       c. Requirements are numbered and indicated by the word “shall.”  Explanatory or   guidance text is indicated in italics beginning in section 4.    d. Programs, projects, and elements are responsible for flowing requirements down to   contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers of components at the lowest level.  Program  contractors may elect to manufacture deliverable GSE to flight hardware requirements if using  flight hardware requirements (1) does not increase risk, (2) represents an overall cost savings,  and (3) does not violate local, State, or federal laws.     e. Along with identifying this Standard for design and development of GSE, programs,  in conjunction with Engineering and Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) organizations, have  the responsibility to:      (1) Determine categories or types of GSE (e.g., critical vs. noncritical) and any  additional requirements resulting from these categories or types.        NASA-STD-5005C     APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE — DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED     13 of 78   (2) Establish and define where this Standard will be applied and when such  boundaries require clarification.     (3) Establish program- and project-specific requirements.    (4) Establish minimum configuration management systems to retain the required   documentation.     f. This Standard does not apply to the following:     (1)  Equipment that is used solely during the manufacturing of flight hardware.  (2) Ground support systems (GSSs) that interface with GSE.   (3) Facilities.  (4) Tools.     1.3 Tailoring    Tailoring of this Standard for application to a specific program or project shall be formally  documented as part of program or project requirements and approved by the Technical Authority.
This standard establishes uniform requirements for applying Data Matrix  identification symbols to parts used on NASA programs/projects using direct part marking  (DPM) methods and techniques. Overall program/project requirements related to the use of the  Data Matrix symbol include: symbol criteria, marking method selection, marking surface  preparation, marking location, protective coatings, and reading standards. This document  addresses the marking of human readable characters or temporary part identification markings  (bands, labels, or tags).  On new programs, human readable characters can be applied using  the same marking methods defined in this standard.  Data Matrix symbols can be added to parts  used on existing programs, provided there is adequate area to accommodate the mark and the  structural integrity of the part is not compromised.      1.2 Purpose.  This standard is intended to provide general requirements for applying  Data Matrix identification symbols safely onto products using permanent direct part marking  (DPM) methods and techniques.  The standard addresses symbol structure only as it relates to  marking and reading limitations.  Technical specifications related to the Data Matrix symbol are  found in AIM International, Inc. technical specification titled “International Symbology  Specification – Data Matrix. Technical information related to how to apply the markings is  addressed in NASA-HDBK-6003A, Application of Data Matrix Identification Symbols to  Aerospace Parts Using Direct Part Marking Methods/Techniques.       1.3 Applicability.  This standard recommends engineering practices for NASA programs  and projects.  It may be cited in contracts and program documents as a technical requirement or  as a reference for guidance.  Determining the suitability of this handbook and its provisions is  the responsibility of program/project management and the performing organization.  Individual  provisions of this standard may be tailored (i.e., modified or deleted) by contract or program  specifications to meet specific program/project needs and constraints.  Human readable  markings applied to NASA aircraft maintained under FAA certificate (e.g., Part 121, Part 135)  shall comply with the requirements of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.     1.4 Environmental Stewardship.  Environmental, health and safety impacts in processes  and materials should be considered when employing identification marking methods and  techniques.  Alternative, "environmentally friendly", materials, which contain low/no volatile  organic compounds (VOCs), should be considered when determining the appropriate  method/technique for each marking application.  Many types of ink contain VOCs, such as  methyl ethyl ketone, xylene, and toluene, which are principal components in atmospheric  reactions that form ozone and other photochemical oxidants.  Exposures to VOC containing  materials have health impacts, which include eye and respiratory irritation, headache, dizziness,  memory impairment, neurotoxicity, cancer.60 This standard establishes uniform requirements for applying Data Matrix  identification symbols to parts used on NASA programs/projects using direct part marking  (DPM) methods and techniques.

1.1 Purpose    The purpose of this Interim Standard is to establish the format and content of two- dimensional (2D) drawings and three-dimensional (3D) models so that rework of these  products by collaborating organizations is minimized.  Adherence to this Interim  Standard will result in enhanced interoperability between organizations exchanging  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) products.    1.2 Applicability    This Interim Standard is applicable to all functions that generate or use 2D drawings and 3D  models (hereinafter called CAD products).  The need for this Interim Standard was identified  by the Constellation Program to support near-term milestones and is, therefore, centered  around the current CAD applications used throughout the Constellation Program.  This  Interim Standard, therefore, reflects the use of Parametric Technology Corporation’s (PTC’s)  Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 3.0 as the application into which CAD products will be integrated.   The Interim Standard will be expanded at a later date to bring the benefit of interoperability to  the rest of the Agency by addressing the data exchange between other CAD applications in  more detail.    Some requirements in this Interim Standard are not specific to any CAD application.  In this  case, suppliers and recipients of CAD products are to adhere to these requirements in order to  benefit from improved interoperability.    This Interim Standard is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers,  including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers, and may be cited  in contract, program, and other Agency documents as a technical requirement.  This Interim  Standard may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory or to other contractors, grant  recipients, or parties to agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in their  contracts, grants, or agreements.    Requirements are indicated by the word “shall.”  Explanatory or guidance text is indicated in  italics beginning in section 4.  Rationale for requirements and guidance is provided in  Appendix A.       NASA-STD-(I)-0007   This document represents the technical consensus of the  developing group but does not yet have final NASA approval.         8 of 28   1.3 Tailoring    Tailoring of this Interim Standard for application to a specific program or project shall be  formally documented as part of program or project requirements and approved by the  Technical Authority.
