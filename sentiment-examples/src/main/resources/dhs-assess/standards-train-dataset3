equipment this revision added paragraphs on repeated circuits, selected and matched parts, and designation of deposited components on hybrid printed circuits. an appendix b was added covering the item designation system of iec publication 113-2. supplement a of 1970 was incorporated into the text, along with minor clarifications and updating of references. significant changes are marked by vertical black bars in the margin, adjacent to the changed text. the 1968 revision and its 1970 supplement coordinated the title with the terms used in related standards, added the class letter u, identified names approved in the federal item identification guide (h6-1), and transferred the class letter list to ieee std 315 (ansi y32.2). the original issue of this standard was prepared by subcommittee 16 on reference designations, appointed by sectional committee y32 on graphic symbols and designations for the purpose of preparing standard reference designations in the field of electrical and electronic equipment. early work on reference designations, of the type herein standardized as the unit numbering method, was done by the symbols committee of the institute of radio engineers and was published in 1949 as standards on designations for electrical, electronic and mechanical parts and their symbols, 49 ire 21.si. in 1951 the u.s. department of defense issued mil-std-16 which closely resembled the ire standard and acknowledged the pioneering work of the ire symbols committee in this field. in order to minimize confusion, intensive and successful efforts have since been made to coordinate the two standards throughout their subsequent revisions. the work on this standard was greatly facilitated by the constant participation of representatives of the department of defense and the ieee symbols committee. as in mil-sfd-16c, the original block numbering method of assigning reference designations has been deleted in favor of the more flexible and universally applicable unit numbering method, whic- is retained, with minor modifications, in section 4 of this standard. the explanation of the block numbering method appearing as appendix a does not form a part of this standard, but is retained for reference in connection with existing equipment on which it was used. the subcommittee was assigned the task of standardizing means for physically locating, through a form of reference designation, the parts and divisions of an equipment. the location numbering method in section 5 and the location coding method in section 6 of this standard are based on existing industry practices which have been successfully used to facilitate manufacture and service of complex apparatus by providing such locating means. they are especially useful in designs making multiple use of identical or closely similar parts of subassemblies.

software software verification and validation (v&v) processes, which determine whether development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity, and whether the software satisfies its intended use and user needs, are described. this determination may include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing of software products and processes. v&v processes assess the software in the context of the system, including the operational environment, hardware, interfacing software, operators, and users.
design procedures for demonstrating the adequacy of new class 1e transformers, located in a mild environment of a nuclear power generating station, to perform their required safety functions under postulated service conditions are presented. single- and three-phase transformers rated 601 v to 15,000 v for the highest voltage winding and up to 2500 kva (self-cooled rating) are covered. because of the conservative approach used in the development of this standard for new transformers, the end-point criteria cannot be used for in-service transformers.
software the process for managing and executing software maintenance activities is described.
system this standard is embodied in the std_logic_1164 package declaration and the semantics of the std_logic_1164 body. an annex is provided to suggest ways in which one might use this package.
circuits standard requirements for all types of electrical control circuits for ac high-voltage breakers rated above 1000 v are given. this standard is applicable for any type of power-operated mechanism and for both ac and dc control power. only basic control elements of the circuit breaker, including reclosing where required, are included in this standard. devices or circuits for protective relaying, special interlocking, etc., are not included.
systems the standard provides an unambiguous and machine-independent definition of the computer programming language extended pascal by specifying requirements for a processor and for a conforming program. its purpose is to facilitate portability of extended pascal programs for use on a wide variety of data processing systems. two levels of compliance are defined for both processors and programs.
system a set of codes and formats to be used by devices connected via the ieee 488.1 bus is specified. this standard also defines communication protocols that are necessary to effect application-independent and device-dependent message exchanges, and further defines common commands and characteristics useful in instrument system applications. it is intended to apply to small-scale to medium-scale instrument systems comprised mainly of measurement, stimulus, and interconnect devices with an instrumentation controller. the standard may also apply to certain devices outside the scope of the instrument system environment. ieee 488.1 subsets, standard message-handling protocols including error handling, unambiguous program and response-message syntactic structures, common commands useful in a wide range of instrument system applications, standard status reporting structures, and system configuration and synchronization protocols are covered. ieee std 488.2-1992 , 488.2 ,
network withdrawn standard. withdrawn date: feb 06, 2006. this standard describes a utility telemetry service architecture operated over the telephone network. the architecture described is a basic transport architecture capable of supporting many different applications. the text is described in terms of a utility meter reading application, but any enhanced service provider (esp) communication can be transported. telemetry calls may be initiated by either the utility/service provider (outbound) or the telemetry interface unit (tiu)/cpe (inbound) on the end user's premise.
networks services and protocol elements that permit the exchange of management information between stations attached to iso/iec standard local and metropolitan area networks are defined. the standard includes the specification of managed objects that permit the operation of the protocol elements to be remotely managed. in addition, an architecture for station discovery and the dynamic control of event forwarding is defined. services and protocols that support station discovery and the dynamic control of event forwarding are defined.
circuits methods are established for testing and measuring the characteristics of surge protectors used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages less than or equal to 1000 v rms or 1200 vdc. the surge protectors are designed to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both. the surge protectors covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear elements. tests are included for characterizing standby performance, surge-limiting capabilities, and surge lifetime. packaged single gas-tube, air-gap, varistor, or avalanche junction surge-protective devices are not covered, nor are test methods for low-voltage power circuit applications.
data data messages, known as protocol data units (pdus), that are exchanged on a network between simulation applications are defined. these pdus are for interactions that take place withinspecified domains called protocol families, which include entity information/interaction, warfare,logistics, simulation management, distributed emission regeneration, radio communications,entity management, minefield, synthetic environment, simulation management with reliability,live entity information/interaction, and non-real time.
systems a design test to evaluate the susceptibility of protective relays to single-frequency electromagnetic fields in the radio frequency domain, such as those generated by portable or mobile radio transceivers is established.
system superseded by 488.1-2003. interface systems used to interconnect both programmable and nonprogrammable electronic measuring apparatus with other apparatus and accessories necessary to assemble instrumentation systems are considered. the standard applies to the interface of instrumentation systems, or portions of them, in which the: data exchanged among the interconnected apparatus is digital, the number of devices that may be interconnected by one contiguous bus does not exceed 15, total transmission path lengths over the interconnecting cables do not exceed 20 m, and the data rate across the interface on any signal line does not exceed 1 mb/s. the basic functional specifications of this standard may also be used in digital interface applications that require longer distances, more devices, increased noise immunity, or combinations of these.
design this standard defines the ieee 1076.1 language, a hardware description language for the description and the simulation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal systems. the language, also informally known as vhdl-ams, is built on ieee std 1076-1993 (vhdl) and extends it with additions and changes to provide capabilities of writing and simulating analog and mixed-signal models.
management the format and contents of software project management plans, applicable to any type or size of software project, are described. the elements that should appear in all software project management plans are identified.
