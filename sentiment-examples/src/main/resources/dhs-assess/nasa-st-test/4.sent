This standard establishes uniform requirements for applying Data Matrix  identification symbols to parts used on NASA programs/projects using direct part marking  (DPM) methods and techniques. Overall program/project requirements related to the use of the  Data Matrix symbol include: symbol criteria, marking method selection, marking surface  preparation, marking location, protective coatings, and reading standards. This document  addresses the marking of human readable characters or temporary part identification markings  (bands, labels, or tags).  On new programs, human readable characters can be applied using  the same marking methods defined in this standard.  Data Matrix symbols can be added to parts  used on existing programs, provided there is adequate area to accommodate the mark and the  structural integrity of the part is not compromised.      1.2 Purpose.  This standard is intended to provide general requirements for applying  Data Matrix identification symbols safely onto products using permanent direct part marking  (DPM) methods and techniques.  The standard addresses symbol structure only as it relates to  marking and reading limitations.  Technical specifications related to the Data Matrix symbol are  found in AIM International, Inc. technical specification titled “International Symbology  Specification – Data Matrix. Technical information related to how to apply the markings is  addressed in NASA-HDBK-6003A, Application of Data Matrix Identification Symbols to  Aerospace Parts Using Direct Part Marking Methods/Techniques.       1.3 Applicability.  This standard recommends engineering practices for NASA programs  and projects.  It may be cited in contracts and program documents as a technical requirement or  as a reference for guidance.  Determining the suitability of this handbook and its provisions is  the responsibility of program/project management and the performing organization.  Individual  provisions of this standard may be tailored (i.e., modified or deleted) by contract or program  specifications to meet specific program/project needs and constraints.  Human readable  markings applied to NASA aircraft maintained under FAA certificate (e.g., Part 121, Part 135)  shall comply with the requirements of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.     1.4 Environmental Stewardship.  Environmental, health and safety impacts in processes  and materials should be considered when employing identification marking methods and  techniques.  Alternative, "environmentally friendly", materials, which contain low/no volatile  organic compounds (VOCs), should be considered when determining the appropriate  method/technique for each marking application.  Many types of ink contain VOCs, such as  methyl ethyl ketone, xylene, and toluene, which are principal components in atmospheric  reactions that form ozone and other photochemical oxidants.  Exposures to VOC containing  materials have health impacts, which include eye and respiratory irritation, headache, dizziness,  memory impairment, neurotoxicity, cancer.60 This standard establishes uniform requirements for applying Data Matrix  identification symbols to parts used on NASA programs/projects using direct part marking  (DPM) methods and techniques.
