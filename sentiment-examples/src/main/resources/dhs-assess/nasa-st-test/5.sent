1.1 Purpose    The purpose of this Interim Standard is to establish the format and content of two- dimensional (2D) drawings and three-dimensional (3D) models so that rework of these  products by collaborating organizations is minimized.  Adherence to this Interim  Standard will result in enhanced interoperability between organizations exchanging  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) products.    1.2 Applicability    This Interim Standard is applicable to all functions that generate or use 2D drawings and 3D  models (hereinafter called CAD products).  The need for this Interim Standard was identified  by the Constellation Program to support near-term milestones and is, therefore, centered  around the current CAD applications used throughout the Constellation Program.  This  Interim Standard, therefore, reflects the use of Parametric Technology Corporation’s (PTC’s)  Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 3.0 as the application into which CAD products will be integrated.   The Interim Standard will be expanded at a later date to bring the benefit of interoperability to  the rest of the Agency by addressing the data exchange between other CAD applications in  more detail.    Some requirements in this Interim Standard are not specific to any CAD application.  In this  case, suppliers and recipients of CAD products are to adhere to these requirements in order to  benefit from improved interoperability.    This Interim Standard is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers,  including Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers, and may be cited  in contract, program, and other Agency documents as a technical requirement.  This Interim  Standard may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory or to other contractors, grant  recipients, or parties to agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in their  contracts, grants, or agreements.    Requirements are indicated by the word “shall.”  Explanatory or guidance text is indicated in  italics beginning in section 4.  Rationale for requirements and guidance is provided in  Appendix A.       NASA-STD-(I)-0007   This document represents the technical consensus of the  developing group but does not yet have final NASA approval.         8 of 28   1.3 Tailoring    Tailoring of this Interim Standard for application to a specific program or project shall be  formally documented as part of program or project requirements and approved by the  Technical Authority.
