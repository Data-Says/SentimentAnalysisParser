This standard defines the basic electrical bonding requirements for NASA  launch vehicles, spacecraft, payloads, and equipment.      1.2 Purpose.  The intent of this standard is to provide fundamental aerospace electrical  bonding requirements.  This standard classifies electrical bonds according to their purpose and  states the requirements for the various classes.  The rationale for specific requirements is  stated where possible.  Additional data is provided to support tailoring for new applications if  necessary.      1.3 Applicability.  This Standard recommends engineering practices for NASA programs  and projects.  It may be cited in contracts and program documents as a technical requirement or  as a reference for guidance.  Determining the suitability of this Standard and its provisions is the  responsibility of program/project management and the performing organization.  Individual  provisions of this standard may be tailored (i.e. modified or deleted) by contract or program  specifications to meet specific program/project needs and constraints.
