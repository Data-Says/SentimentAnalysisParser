1.1 Purpose.  This Standard defines the current minimum desktop hardware  configuration that will be used by NASA to support interoperability.  These specifications apply  to all NASA desktop and portable systems that are required to support interoperability.     1.2 Scope.  Desktop hardware below this minimum configuration may be used in areas  where interoperability is not required.  However, Agency workstations used for interoperability  must meet the criteria specified in section 3.3 of this document.     1.3 Waivers.  The waiver process set forth in NPR 2800.1, paragraph 2.2.4, applies to  this standard.  The desktop standards group, in cooperation with the Chief Technical Officer, will  continue to process waivers on behalf of the Principal Center for Workgroup Hardware and  Software.
