This standard defines the methodologies, practices, and requirements for the conduct of load analyses for payloads and spacecraft.  1.2  Purpose.  This standard establishes general NASA policies for the definition of loads to be used in the design and development of payloads and spacecraft.  Guidelines are prescribed to establish consistent practices and facilitate integration at the project and program levels.  Payloads and spacecraft shall be designed to maintain structural integrity and the required degree of functionality to ensure successful operation during all phases of the expected life cycle.  Flight structures and systems shall consider static and dynamic load environments to be encountered during assembly, testing, transportation, launch, ascent, space operations, extraterrestrial operations, descent, and landing.  1.3  Applicability.  This standard recommends engineering practices for NASA programs and projects.  It may be cited in contracts and program documents as a technical requirement or as a reference for guidance.  Determining the suitability of this standard and its provisions is the responsibility of program/project management and the performing organization.  Individual provisions of this standard may be tailored (i.e., modified or deleted) by contract or program specifications to meet specific program/project needs and constraints.
