system This standard defines a protocol enabling precise synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such as network communication, local computing and distributed objects. The protocol is applicable to systems communicating by local area networks supporting multicast messaging including but not limited to Ethernet. The protocol enables heterogeneous systems that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize to a grandmaster clock. The protocol supports system-wide synchronization accuracy in the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local clock computing resources. The default behavior of the protocol allows simple systems to be installed and operated without requiring the administrative attention of users. The standard includes mappings to UDP/IP, DeviceNet and a layer-2 Ethernet implementation.An Interpretation is available at http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/interp/1588-2008.html

radio Uniform procedures for the measurement of radio noise generated by corona from overhead power lines and substations are established in this standard. Measurement procedures in this standard are also valid for other power-line noise sources such as gaps and harmonics; however, most of the precautionary information, analysis, and data plotting techniques were written and developed primarily for corona discharges. The procedures are not valid for measuring transient radio noise sources that occur during breaker or disconnect switching operations. The procedures apply in the frequency range of 0.010 MHz to 1000 MHz; however, the emphasis is on the standard amplitude-modulation broadcasting (0.535 MHz to 1.605 MHz) and television broadcasting (54 MHz to 72 MHz, 76 MHz to 88 MHz, 174 MHz to 216 MHz, and 470 MHz to 698 MHz) bands.

management The evolution of the harmonized set of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288-12207 related standards and technical reports that are discussed in this International Standardprovides detailed requirements and guidance on the application of system life cycle processes. This International Standard unifies technical and managementrequirements and guidance from several of these sources to specify the requirements for the content of a SEMP and to provide a common SEMP format. This International Standard also identifies the processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 to perform the necessary project planning activities to accomplish the project's technical effort and to develop the project's SEMP.

A statistical method for establishing a relative life-temperature relationship for an insulation system is also described. To have any significance, the reference insulation system must be supported with adequate field service data. Evaluation of insulation systems for use in air-cooled, random-wound ac electric machinery with usual service conditions is this procedure s intent. This procedure, on its own, does not cover insulation systems such as exposure to conducting contaminates, radiation, inverter applications, or operation in oils, refrigerants, or other media that potentially degrades insulating materials.

While both human and machine readable, in its most common usage it will be machine written and machine read in support of timing analysis and verification tools, and of other tools requiring delay and timing information. The primary audience for this standard is the implementers of tools supporting the format, but anyone with a need to understand the formats contents will find it useful.
interface This standard represents an extension to the IEEE 1505 receiver fixture interface (RFI) standard specification. Particular emphasis is placed on defining within the IEEE 1505 RFI standard a more specific set of performance requirements that employ a common scalable: (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific connector modules; (c) respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation; and (e) legacy automatic test equipment (ATE) transitional devices.

interface A mechanical and electrical specification for implementing a common interoperable mechanical quick-disconnect interconnect system for use by industry for interfacing large numbers of electrical signals (digital, analog, RF, power, etc.) is provided. These large interface panels (receiver and fixture panels) are employed primarily in test systems between stimulus/measurement assets and a related unit-under-test (UUT), although any application involving high-density contacts requiring a quick disconnect interface could benefit. The receiver is a receptacle that is mounted to test system mates with multiple fixtures, which serve as thebuffer between the UUT and automatic test equipment (ATE). Fixtures translate standard input/output (I/O) signal routing offered at the receiver to a wiring interface that directly connects to the UUT. These UUT interfaces can represent cable connectors, direct plug-in (printed circuit board edge connectors), sensor monitoring, or manual feedback from the test technician.The primary objectives of this standard are: (a) to establish interface standards that permit interchangeability of mechanical/electrical receiver/fixture/connector product assemblies from various manufacturers under an open architecture; and (b) to develop within this framework a defined set(s) of interconnecting connector and mechanical specifications that supports available, accepted, low-cost commercial technology to reduced dependence on proprietary designs and extend life-cycle availability.

device Identity assertion, role gathering, multilevel access control, assurance, and auditing are provided by the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS). The BOPS implementation includes software running on a client device (smartphone or mobile device), a trusted BOPS server, and an intrusion detection system. The BOPS implementation allows pluggable components to replace existing components functionality, accepting integration into current operating environments in a short period of time. The BOPS implementation provides continuous protection to the resources and assurance of the placement and viability of adjudication and other key features. Accountability is the mechanism that proves a service-level guarantee of security. The BOPS implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface. The BOPS implementation need not know whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The BOPS implementation functionality offers a point-and-cut mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is language neutral, allowing Representational State Transfer (REST), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security to provide the communication interface.

However, the requirements for the life-cycle processesdo not uniquely and unambiguously state the requirements for the information items contents or the information needed by a user of an information item. Moreover, the information from the life-cycle processes may overlap or may be created and revised at different times.

systems This standard is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications and user interfaces to open systems. It defines the Ada language bindings as package specifications and accompanying textual descriptions to the application program interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the source level through the binding between ISO 8652:1987 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1990) (POSIX). Terminology and general requirements, process primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input and output primitives, device- and class-specific functions, language-specific services for Ada, and system databases are covered. It also specifies behavior to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada compilation system. The emphasis in POSIX is on application programs, so the interfaces in this document are not sufficient to implement an Ada compilation system or a POSIX shell, nor is this standard meant to be sufficient for real-time applications.

management This standard defines system engineering and management requirements for the life cycle of websites, including strategy, design, engineering, testing and validation, and management and sustainment for Intranet and Extranet environments. The goal of this standard is to improve the usability of informational websites and ease of maintenance of managed Web operations in terms of locating relevant and timely information, applying information security management, facilitating ease of use, and providing for consistent and efficient development and maintenance practices. .It applies to those using web technology to present information and communications technology (ICT) information, such as user documentation for systems and software, life-cycle documentation for systems and software engineering projects, and documentation of policies, plans, and procedures for IT service management. This standard provides requirements for website owners and website providers, managers responsible for establishing guidelines for website development and operations, for software developers and operations and maintenance staff who may be external or internal to the website owner's organization. It applies to websites for public access and for limited access, such as for users, customers, and subscribers seeking information on IT products and services. It includes increased emphasis on the human factors concerns for making information easily retrievable and usable for the intended audience. It focuses on vendor- and product-independent considerations.
software The purpose and content of all identified systems and software life cycle and service management information items (documentation) are specified in this standard. The information item contents are defined according to generic document types, as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose of the document (Clause 10). This International Standard provides a mapping of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013), and ISO/IEC 20000-2 (IEEE Std 20000-2:2013) clauses with a set of information items. This International Standard identifies records and information items based on analysis of references in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013) and ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012 (IEEE 20000-2:2013), which in some cases provide partial or complete outlines for the content of specific documents. However, the requirements for the life-cycle processesdo not uniquely and unambiguously state the requirements for the information items contents or the information needed by a user of an information item. Moreover, the information from the life-cycle processes may overlap or may be created and revised at different times. In short, the analyzed references do not result in a logically complete list of information items.
management The requirements for the application of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, System Life Cycle Processes for defense systems engineering needs are provided in this standard. This standard implements ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for use by United States Department of Defense (DoD) organizations and other defense agencies in acquiring systems or systems engineering support. While primarily supporting the acquirer-supplier agreement mode, this standard also can be used to support the other modes: use by organizations, projects, and process assessors. This standard provides the basis for selection, negotiation, agreement, and performance of necessary systems engineering activities and delivery of products, while allowing flexibility for both innovative implementation and tailoring of the specific systems engineering process(es) to be used by system suppliers, either contractors or government system developers,integrators, maintainers, or sustainers.
software A common framework for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans is established by this standard. It defines a set of processes and associated terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction.
management This International Standard provides requirements for the management of the content used in product life cycle, software, and service management system documentation. Content management allows an organization to control the storage and retrieval of content objects, track content revisions, maintain a content audit trail, and enable a collaborative environment. Component content management supports the reuse of content objects among deliverables and supports multiple deliverable formats. Content objects that are unique and are maintained as independent database objects are efficient to review, approve, and update; may be combined to produce multiple deliverables; and are cost-effective to translate. The standard defines the characteristics of an effective and efficient process through which content is gathered, managed, and published, including the requirements of a system that is supported by an electronic database. Such a database should support documents or topics and content units that may be assembled to produce complete documents for print, electronic output, or content collections published through electronic media. This database is defined as a component content management system (CCMS), as distinct from a document management system. The objective of component content management is to create content objects once and use them through linking mechanisms in multiple output formats including but not limited to documents. Systems conforming to this standard can fulfill business needs for content development and management, especially the need for a single source of authoritative information. The standard includes business case considerations for acquisition of a content management system. This International Standard is independent of the software tools and markup languages that may be used to manage documentation content, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation.

Network MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability and general information relevant to specific MAC types are defined in this standard. Link Aggregation allows parallel full-duplex point-to-point links to be used as if they were a single link and also supports the use of multiple links as a resilient load sharing interconnect between multiple nodes in two separately administered networks.
security An abstraction layer for multiple home networking technologies that provides a common interface to widely deployed home networking technologies is defined in this standard: IEEE 1901䋢 over power lines, IEEE 802.11䋢 for wireless, Ethernet over twisted pair cable, and MoCA 1.1 over coax. Additional network technologies are supported by an extensible mechanism using an IEEE OUI and an XML-formatted document. Connectivity selection for transmission of packets arriving from any interface or application is supported by the 1905 abstraction layer. Modification to the underlying home networking technologies is not required by the 1905 abstraction layer, and hence it does not change the behavior or implementation of existing home networking technologies. The 1905 abstraction layer is between layers 2 and 3 and abstracts the individual details of each interface, aggregates available bandwidth, and facilitates seamless integration. The 1905 abstraction layer also facilitates end-to-end quality of service (QoS) while simplifying the introduction of new devices to the network, establishing secure connections, extending network coverage, and facilitating advanced network management features including discovery, path selection, autoconfiguration, and QoS negotiation.

equipment This standard applies to organizations that conduct qualification tests on equipment that has a definable safety function and is an identifiable part of a safety system for use in nuclear power generating stations. It requires a technical program, a quality assurance program, and a demonstrated ability to meet specified technical requirements. It does not apply to materials tests, production tests, normal performance testing, qualification by analysis, qualification by operating experience, or reliability tests such as diesel-generator multiple start tests.
management Cybersecurity measures require that a balance be achieved between technical feasibility and economic feasibility and that this balance addresses the risks expected to be present at a substation. Further, cybersecurity measures must be designed and implemented in such a manner that access and operation to legitimate activities is not impeded, particularly during times of emergency or restoration activity. This standard presents a balance of the above factors.

equipment Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for device communication, a normative definition of the communication between sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment (SABTE) devices (agents) and managers (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, personal health appliances, set top boxes), in a manner that enables plug-and-play interoperability, is established in this standard. It leverages appropriate portions of existing standards including ISO/IEEE 11073 terminology, information models, application profile standards, and transport standards. It specifies the use of specific term codes, formats, and behaviors in telehealth environments restricting optionality in base frameworks in favor of interoperability. This standard defines a common core of communication functionality for SABTE. In this context, SABTE is defined as a device that is intended to alleviate the symptoms of a patient who suffers from sleep apnoea by delivering a therapeutic breathing pressure to the patient. SABTE is primarily used in the home health-care environment by a lay operator without direct professional supervision.

It reflects small editorial changes needed to coordinate with the final wording contained in the defining standards ANSI/IEEE C37.04-1999 and ANSI/IEEE C37.09-1999. Some ratings have also been updated. Because this revision is primarily editorial in nature, this Foreword describes the substantive and editorial changes between this revision and the 1987 version.The format of the tables remains very much the same, except that some ratings, which had been given in the notes (sometimes on a different page from the table of preferred ratings), have been listed explicitly in the tables.
software Requirements for initiating, planning, controlling, and executing the Software Quality Assurance processes of a software development or maintenance project are established in this standard.

circuits Surge protectors for application on multiconductor balanced or unbalanced data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages equal to or less than 1000 Vrms, or 1200 V dc are covered by this standard. These surge protectors are designed to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both. The methods of testing and criteria for determining the end of life of electrical surge protectors used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits are described. The surge protectors covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear elements, packaged for the purpose of limiting voltage, current, or both.

wireless A guide to evaluating electromagnetic immunity of medical devices against radiatedradio-frequency (RF) emissions from common RF transmitters is provided in this recommendedpractice (e.g., two-way radios; walkie-talkies; mobile phones; wireless-enabled tablets, e-readers,laptop computers, and similar devices; RFID readers; networked mp3 players; two-way pagers;and wireless personal digital assistants [PDAs]). A comprehensive test or a guarantee is notprovided by this protocol but, instead, a basic evaluation is given that can help identify medicaldevices that might be particularly vulnerable to interference from common RF transmitters.Existing or newly purchased medical devices can be evaluated by this ad hoc test protocol or theprotocol can be implemented for prepurchase evaluation. This recommended practice applies tomedical devices used in health-care facilities but can also be adapted to medical devices in homehealth-care or mobile health-care settings. It does not apply to implantable medical devices (e.g.,pacemakers and defibrillators), transport environments such as ambulances and helicopters, orRF transmitters rated at more than 8 W of output power. Testing with transmitters greater than8 W in health-care facilities is not recommended because of possible adverse effects on critical care medical devices that are in use in nearby areas of the facility. Finally, in-band RFinterference where the fundamental frequency of an RF transmitter overlaps with frequenciesused by a hospital wireless network or monitoring or other medical device wireless links is notaddressed by this recommended practice.
data An architecture for the interconnection of IEEE 802 Local Area Networks (LANs) below the level of the MAC Service, which is transparent to logical link control (LLC) and higher layer protocols, is defined.

devices IEEE Std 1708 establishes a normative definition of wearable cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of this kind of device. The standard is independent of the form of the device or the vehicle to which the device is attached or in which it is embedded. The standard is applicable to all types of wearable BP measurement devices including epidermal and unobtrusive BP devices that have different modes of operation (e.g., to measure short-term, long-term, snapshot, continuous, beat(s)-to-beat(s) BP, or BP variability). This standard is, however, limited to evaluation of devices that do not use a cuff during measurement and do not cover evaluation of all sphygmomanometers that are used with an occluding or inflatable cuff for the indirect determination of BP on the upper arm or wrist. This standard provides guidelines for manufacturers to qualify and validate their products, potential purchasers or users to evaluate and select prospective products, and health care professionals to understand the manufacturing practices on wearable BP devices.

A comprehensive test or a guarantee is not provided by this protocol but, instead, a basic evaluation is given that can help identify medical devices that might be particularly vulnerable to interference from common RF transmitters. Existing or newly purchased medical devices can be evaluated by this ad hoc test protocol or the protocol can be implemented for prepurchase evaluation. This recommended practice applies to medical devices used in health-care facilities but can also be adapted to medical devices in home health-care or mobile health-care settings. It does not apply to implantable medical devices (e.g., pacemakers and defibrillators), transport environments such as ambulances and helicopters, or RF transmitters rated at more than 8 W of output power. Testing with transmitters greater than 8 W in health-care facilities is not recommended because of possible adverse effects on criticalcare medical devices that are in use in nearby areas of the facility. Finally, in-band RF interference where the fundamental frequency of an RF transmitter overlaps with frequencies used by a hospital wireless network or monitoring or other medical device wireless links is not addressed by this recommended practice.

software ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 is adopted by this standard. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 specifies minimum requirements for the structure and contents of an assurance case to improve the consistency and comparability of assurance cases and to facilitate stakeholder communications, engineering decisions, and other uses of assurance cases. An assurance case includes a top-level claim for a property of a system or product (or set of claims), systematic argumentation regarding this claim, and the evidence and explicit assumptions that underlie this argumentation. Arguing through multiple levels of subordinate claims, this structured argumentation connects the top-level claim to the evidence and assumptions. Assurance cases are generally developed to support claims in areas such as safety, reliability, maintainability, human factors, operability, and security, although these assurance cases are often called by more specific names, e.g. safety case or reliability and maintainability (R&M) case. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 does not place requirements on the quality of the contents of an assurance case and does not require the use of a particular terminology or graphical representation. Likewise, it places no requirements on the means of physical implementation of the data, including no requirements for redundancy or co-location.

The NGSON architecture provides advanced service- and transport-related functions to support context-aware, dynamically adaptive, and self-organizing networks. This standard specifies a functional architecture for NGSON. The functional architecture consists of a set of functional entities (FEs), their functions, reference points, and information flows to illustrate service interaction and media delivery among FEs and external components. NGSON may operate with different underlying networks such as IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), next generation network (NGN), peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay, or Web to transmit NGSON signaling messages and/or media among its users and services.

systems VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is defined. VHDL is a formal notation intended for use in all phases of the creation of electronic systems. Because it is both machine readable and human readable, it supports the development, verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware designs; the communication of hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification, and procurement of hardware. Its primary audiences are the implementors of tools supporting the language and the advanced users of the language.
design This standard describes software designs and establishes the information content and organization of a software design description (SDD). An SDD is a representation of a software design to be used for recording design information and communicating that design information to key design stakeholders. This standard is intended for use in design situations in which an explicit software design description is to be prepared. These situations include traditional software construction activities, when design leads to code, and reverse engineering situations when a design description is recovered from an existing implementation. This standard can be applied to commercial, scientific, or military software that runs on digital computers. Applicability is not restricted by the size, complexity, or criticality of the software. This standard can be applied to the description of high-level and detailed designs. This standard does not prescribe specific methodologies for design, configuration management, or quality assurance. This standard does not require the use of any particular design languages, but establishes requirements on the selection of design languages for use in an SDD. This standard can be applied to the preparation of SDDs captured as paper documents, automated databases, software development tools or other media.
systems Adoption of IEEE Std 1076-2008. VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is defined. VHDL is a formal notation intended for use in all phases of the creation of electronic systems. Because it is both machine readable and human readable, it supports the development, verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware designs; the communication of hardware design data; and the maintenance, modification, and procurement of hardware. Its primary audiences are the implementors of tools supporting the language and the advanced users of the language.

network A protection profile for hardcopy devices in a small, private information processing environment is discussed in this standard in which most elements of security are provided by the physical environment, but basic network security is needed to protect the device and its network from misuse from outside of the environment. Small offices and home offices are typical applications of this environment. This environment will be known as "operational environment D".
network A Protection Profile for Hardcopy Devices in a public-facing environment is provided in this standard in which document security is not guaranteed, but access control and usage accounting are important to the operator of the environment. A retail copy center, public library, Internet cafe, and hotel business center are typical applications of this environment. This environment will be known as "Operational Environment C".

Data This specification describes circuitry that may be added to an integrated circuit to provide access to on-chip test access ports (TAPs) specified by IEEE Std 1149.1�ˌ�-2001. The circuitry uses IEEE 1149.1-2001 as its foundation, providing complete backward compatibility, while aggressively adding features to support test and applications debug. It defines six classes of 1149.7 test access ports (TAP.7s), T0-T5, with each class providing incremental capability, building on that of the lower level classes. Class TO provides the behavior specified by 1149.1 from startup when there are multiple on-chip TAPs. Class T1 adds common debug functions and features to minimize power consumption. Class T2 adds operating modes that maximize scan performance. It also provides an optional hot-connection capability to prevent system corruption when a connection is made to a powered system. Class T3 supports operation in either a fourwire series or star scan topology. Class T4 provides for communication with either a two-pin or four-pin interface. The two-pin operation serializes 1149.1 transactions and provides for higher test clock rates. Class T5 adds the ability to perform data transfers concurrent with scan, supports utilization of functions other than scan, and provides control of TAP.7 pins to custom debug technologies in a manner that ensures current and future interoperability.
security Port-based network access control allows a network administrator to restrict the use of IEEE 802 LAN service access points (ports) to secure communication between authenticated and authorized devices. This standard specifies a common architecture, functional elements, and protocols that support mutual authentication between the clients of ports attached to the same LAN and that secure communication between the ports, including the media access method independent protocols that are used to discover and establish the security associations used by IEEE 802.1AE MAC Security.

system A reference model that provides a common interpretation basis by which tools can express and communicate the observable features of system/software behavior to users and to other tools is presented. This standard specifies a Conceptual Metamodel for understanding and describing the causal behavior for a system. The purpose of this Conceptual Metamodel is to express causal behavior and compositions of causal behavior in a model that integrates all observable operational features of a system into one behavior specification. This Conceptual Metamodel is useful for analyzing systems, for constructing particular system behavior models, and for using those models in the specification, design, and evaluation of engineered systems. It provides the necessary semantic elements for describing general hardware/software systems, including hardware-only, software-only, or mixed system components, and it allows these different types of components to be treated in a consistent manner, providing a basis for representing a wide variety of systems.

systems In this paper, technical background and application details to support understanding of IEEE Std 1547-2003 are provided.

The IEEE 1547 series of standards is cited in the Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, and this guide is one document in the IEEE 1547 series.
circuit This standard is revised to change the descriptions of the standard transient recovery voltage (TRV) envelope and ratings. This is applicable for AC high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V and on a symmetrical current basis. The capability limits of these circuit breakers are determined to a major degree by the TRV. The revised descriptions of TRV bring the TRV requirements in IEEE standards into harmony with the TRV requirements in IEC standards that apply to the same type and class of equipment.
networks This standard defines the air interface for radiating transceiver radio tags using long wavelength signals (kilometric and hectometric frequencies, <450 kHz). Conforming devices can have very low power consumption (a few microwatts on average), while operating over medium ranges (0.5 to 30 meters) and at low data transfer speeds (300-9600 bps). They are well suited for visibility networks, sensors, effectors and battery operated displays. This standard fills a gap between non-network-based RFID standards (e.g., ISO/IEC CD 15961-3, ISO 18000-6C or ISO 18000-7) and existing high bandwidth network standards such as IEEE Std 802.11trade and IEEE 802.15.4trade.
interface The power supplied to elements in an electronic design affects the way circuits operate. Although this is obvious when stated, today's set of high-level design languages have not had a consistent way to concisely represent the regions of a design with different power provisions, nor the states of those regions or domains. This standard provides an HDL-independent way of annotating a design with power intent. In addition, the level-shifting and isolation between power domains may be described for a specific implementation, from high-level constraints to particular configurations. When the logic in a power domain receives different power supply levels, the logic state of portions of the design may be preserved with various state-retention strategies. This standard provides mechanisms for the refined and specific description of intent, effect, and implementation of various retention strategies. Incorporating components into designs is greatly assisted by the encapsulation and specification of the characteristics of the power environment of the design and the power requirements and capabilities of the components; this information encapsulation mechanism is also described in this standard. The analysis of the various power modes of a design is enabled with a combination of the description of the power modes and the collection, generation, and propagation of switching information.

POSIX. 1-2008 is intended to be used by both application developers and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated volume): [1]General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume. [2] Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume. [3] Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a "shell") and common utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume. [4] Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of POSIX. 1-2008 and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume. The following areas are outside the scope of POSIX. 1-2008: Graphics interfaces Database management system interfaces Record I/O considerations Object or binary code portability System configuration and resource availability. POSIX. 1-2008 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.
interface This trial-use standard represents an extension to the IEEE 1505 receiver fixture interface (RFI) standard specification. Particular emphasis is placed on defining within the IEEE 1505 RFI standard a more specific set of performance requirements that employ a common scalable: (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific connector modules; (c) respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation; and (e) legacy automatic test equipment (ATE) transitional devices. This is intentionally done to standardize the footprint and assure mechanical and electrical interoperability between past and future automatic test systems (ATS).
wireless This amendment defines enhancements to the IEEE 802.11 physical layer (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) to support operation in the 3650�ˌ�3700 MHz band in the United States.
management Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group, such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links, consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent link aggregation capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support link aggregation.
device This standard guides manufacturers/suppliers in planning and implementing the controls for the design and manufacture of lithium-ion (Li-ion) and lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion polymer) rechargeable battery packs used for multi-cell mobile computing devices. The provisions of this standard work together to define approaches to design, test, and evaluate a cell, battery pack, and host device to mitigate battery system failure. Additionally, this standard provides recommendations for end-user education and communication materials. This approach recommends the interfaces between subsystems (for example, cell, battery pack, host device, power adapter, etc.), and end users are as important to system reliability as is robust subsystem design and testing. This standard, therefore, includes subsystem interface design responsibilities for each subsystem manufacturer/supplier, and it provides messaging and communication provisions for end-user awareness. Therefore, the responsibility for total system reliability is shared between the designers/manufacturers/suppliers of the subsystems and the end user. Compliance to this standard requires adherence to all the provisions of the standard.

radio This standard provides definitions and explanations of key concepts in the fields of spectrum management, cognitive radio, policy-defined radio, adaptive radio, software-defined radio, and related technologies. The document goes beyond simple, short definitions by providing amplifying text that explains these terms in the context of the technologies that use them. The document also describes how these technologies interrelate and create new capabilities while at the same time providing mechanisms supportive of new spectrum management paradigms such as dynamic spectrum access.
networks The technical requirements of this standard form a compatibility standard for mobile broadband wireless access systems. The standard ensures that a compliant access terminal (AT) or user terminal (UT) can obtain service through any access node (AN) or base station (BS) conforming to properly selected modes of this standard, consistent with equipment and operator requirements, thus providing a framework for the rapid development of cost-effective, multivendor mobile broadband wireless access systems. This compatibility standard is targeted for use in a wide variety of licensed frequency bands and regulatory environments.This standard provides for future standardized extension capabilities. The architecture defined by this standard permits such expansion without the loss of backward compatibility.
Networks This amendment defines an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple provider bridged networks, allowing a provider to support up to 2<sup>24</sup> service instances.
system A protocol is provided in this standard that enables precise synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such as network communication, local computing, and distributed objects. The protocol is applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems are enabled that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize. System-wide synchronization accuracy and precision in the sub-microsecond range are supported with minimal network and local clock computing resources. Simple systems are installed and operated without requiring the management attention of users because the default behavior of the protocol allows for it.
circuit Metal-oxide surge arresters designed to repeatedly limit the voltage surges on 48 Hz to 62 Hz power circuits (>1000 V) by passing surge discharge current and automatically limiting the flow of system power current applies to this amendment. This amendment covers devices for separate mounting and to those supplied integrally with other equipment. The tests demonstrate that an arrester can survive the rigors of reasonable environmental conditions and system phenomena, while, at the same time, protect equipment and/or the system from damaging overvoltages caused by lightning, switching, or other undesirable surges.
wireless This amendment specifies the extensions to IEEE Std 802.11-2007 for wireless local area networks (WLANs) providing mechanisms for fast basic service set (BSS) transition.
device This standard defines security requirements (all aspects of security including but not limited to authentication, authorization, privacy, integrity, device management, physical security and information security) for manufacturers, users, and others on the selection, installation, configuration and usage of hardcopy devices (HCDs) and systems; including printers, copiers, and multifunction devices (MFDs). This standard identifies security exposures for these HCDs and systems, and instructs manufacturers and software developers on appropriate security capabilities to include in their devices and systems, and instructs users on appropriate ways to use these security capabilities.
radio This amendment specifies the extensions to IEEE Std 802.11 for Wireless LANs providing mechanisms for Radio Resource Measurement.
networking This amendment adds requirements to IEEE Std 1613-2003 relating to the altitude of installed communications networking devices, and the derating factors for dielectric power frequency tests and rated maximum ambient temperatures if the installation is above a specified altitude.
design This standard describes design and performance requirements along with testing methods for evaluating radiation detection instruments that are pocket-sized and worn on the body for the purpose of rapid detection and identification of radioactive materials. The performance requirements contained in this standard are meant to provide a means for verifying the capability of these instruments to reliably detect changes above background levels of radiation, notify the user to these changes, and provide a means to determine if the alarm was caused by a radionuclide of interest that may require further evaluation. These devices are not primarily intended to provide a measurement of dose-equivalent rate. However, their indication can provide an approximate value of exposure rate that should be reasonably accurate. They are also not meant to provide radionuclide identification at the same level as radionuclide identification detectors defined in ANSI N42.34.1 Successful completion of the tests described in this standard should not be construed as an ability to identify all radionuclides in all environments.
data The requirements for SCADA and automation systems in substations are defined. This standard defines the process of substation integration as the design process that is the foundation for substation automation. Functional and environmental requirements are provided for all IEDs located in the system. Tutorial material is included in the annexes to address common issues with systems without introducing requirements. Information is also presented in the annexes regarding SCADA masters.
system The scope of this trial-use standard is the definition of an exchange format, using eXtensible Markup Language (XML), for identifying all of the hardware, software, and documentation that may be used to test and diagnose a UUT on an automatic test system (ATS)
qualifieddesign Directions and requirements are provided for the conversion of qualified power switchgear equipment. Examples such as low-voltage power circuit breakers; high-voltage outdoor, and medium-voltage indoor draw out power circuit breakers; medium-voltage fused contactors; medium-voltage ground and test devices; medium-voltage fused load interrupter switches; and all metal-enclosed switchgear are covered. Existing design standards are referenced with appropriate guidance on design testing necessary to design-verify the conversions. Reconditioning, which concerns the maintenance of existing equipment without alteration, is not covered.
equipment This revision added paragraphs on repeated circuits, selected and matched parts, and designation of deposited components on hybrid printed circuits. An appendix B was added covering the Item Designation system of IEC Publication 113-2. Supplement A of 1970 was incorporated into the text, along with minor clarifications and updating of references. Significant changes are marked by vertical black bars in the margin, adjacent to the changed text. The 1968 revision and its 1970 Supplement coordinated the title with the terms used in related standards, added the class letter U, identified names approved in the Federal Item Identification Guide (H6-1), and transferred the class letter list to IEEE Std 315 (ANSI Y32.2). The original issue of this standard was prepared by Subcommittee 16 on Reference Designations, appointed by Sectional Committee Y32 on Graphic Symbols and Designations for the purpose of preparing standard reference designations in the field of electrical and electronic equipment. Early work on reference designations, of the type herein standardized as the Unit Numbering Method, was done by the Symbols Committee of the Institute of Radio Engineers and was published in 1949 as Standards on Designations for Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Parts and their Symbols, 49 IRE 21.SI. In 1951 the U.S. Department of Defense issued MIL-STD-16 which closely resembled the IRE Standard and acknowledged the pioneering work of the IRE Symbols Committee in this field. In order to minimize confusion, intensive and successful efforts have since been made to coordinate the two standards throughout their subsequent revisions. The work on this standard was greatly facilitated by the constant participation of representatives of the Department of Defense and the IEEE Symbols Committee. As in MIL-SfD-16C, the original Block Numbering Method of assigning reference designations has been deleted in favor of the more flexible and universally applicable Unit Numbering Method, whic- is retained, with minor modifications, in Section 4 of this standard. The explanation of the Block Numbering Method appearing as Appendix A does not form a part of this standard, but is retained for reference in connection with existing equipment on which it was used. The subcommittee was assigned the task of standardizing means for physically locating, through a form of reference designation, the parts and divisions of an equipment. The Location Numbering Method in Section 5 and the Location Coding Method in Section 6 of this standard are based on existing industry practices which have been successfully used to facilitate manufacture and service of complex apparatus by providing such locating means. They are especially useful in designs making multiple use of identical or closely similar parts of subassemblies.
system This document specifies an exchange format, using XML, for identifying all of the hardware, software, and documentation associated with a unit under test (UUT). This UUT may be tested and diagnosed using a test program set (TPS) on an automatic test system (ATS).
devices Drawout-type ground and test devices for use in medium-voltage metal-clad switchgear rated 4.76 kV through 38 kV are covered. The description, design, and testing of these accessory devices that are inserted in place of drawout circuit breakers for the purpose of grounding and testing are also covered.
systems This standard is intended to promote and facilitate interoperability between components of an automatic test system (e.g., between test executive and diagnostic reasoner)where test results need to be shared. The standard thus facilitates the capture of test results data in storage devices and databases, facilitating online and offline analysis. The test results schema becomes a class of information that can be used within the SIMICA family of standards.
security The performance criteria for active interrogation systems in homeland security applications are described in this standard. These systems are intended for non-intrusive inspection of closed containers, vehicles, and packages of a wide range of types and sizes. In these systems, the contents of an inspection zone are irradiated with penetrating ionizing radiation to determine the presence of a hidden substance-of-interest by the analysis of stimulated secondary radiations or nuclear-resonance absorption spectra that are indicative of the chemical and/or nuclidic composition of the substance-of-interest.
security The functions and features to be provided in substation intelligent electronic devices (lEDs) to accommodate critical infrastructure protection programs are defined in this standard. Security regarding the access, operation, configuration, firmware revision, and data retrieval from an IED is addressed in this standard. Communications for the purpose of power system protection (teleprotection) is not addressed. Encryption for the secure transmission of data both within and external to the substation, including supervisory control and data acquisition, is not part of this standard as this is addressed in other efforts.
Systems Revision of IEEE Std 741-1997. This standard prescribes criteria that establish protection requirements for Class 1E power systems and equipment. It describes the purpose of and the means for obtaining protection from electrical and mechanical damage, or failures that can occur within a time period that is shorter than that required for operator action. It includes testing and surveillance requirements. It does not include plant physical design requirements to protect against events such as pipe whip, fire, dropped load, etc.
device Standard Test Interface Language (STIL) provides an interface between digital test generationtools and test equipment. A test description language is defined that: (a) facilitates the transferof digital test vector data from CAE to ATE environments; (b) specifies pattern, format, andtiming information sufficient to define the application of digital test vectors to a DUT; and (c) supportsthe volume of test vector data generated from structured tests.
equipment This standard provides the means to define and describe signals used in testing. It alsoprovides a set of common basic signals, mathematically underpinned so that signals can be combinedto form complex signals usable across all test platforms.
network This amendment to Local and Metropolitan Area Network standard, ISO/IEC 8802-5 : 1998, is part of a family of local area network (LAN) standards dealing with the physical and data link layers as defined by the ISO/IEC Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model. The requirements for dedicated token ring (DTR) operation are specified, including the changes and additions to the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to provide for an additional full-duplex mode of operation (switching), and for interconnection of shared LAN segments to switch ports. Also specified are the characteristics of a fibre optic interface for connecting a 4 Mbit/s or 16 Mbit/s token ring station to the trunk coupling unit (TCU) of a token ring, including station, port, and channel requirements. Fibre optic trunk signaling recommendations are also made.
design This standard defines the IEEE 1076.1 language, a hardware description language for the description and the simulation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal systems. The language, also informally known as VHDL-AMS, is built on IEEE Std 1076trade-2002 (VHDL) and extends it with additions and changes to provide capabilities of writing and simulating analog and mixed-signal models.
interface It defines the functions that are to be performed by a transducer interface module (TIM) and the common characteristics for all devices that implement the TIM. It specifies the formats for Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS). It defines a set of commands to facilitate the setup and control of the TIM as well as reading and writing the data used by the system. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are defined to facilitate communications with the TIM and with applications.
systems IEEE specifications for high-voltage (above 1000 V) distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches and associated accessories with rated voltages from 1 kV through 8.3 kV are established. All of these devices are intended for use on alternating current distribution systems. These include distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches, supports, mountings, fuse hooks, and tongs, all of the type used exclusively with distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches, and distribution class enclosed single-pole air switches used in enclosure packages.
network This standard defines the protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low-data-rate, low-power and low-complexity, short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network (WPAN).
system The operation, functions, and attributes of a parallel system bus (PSB), called MULTIBUS II, are defined. A high-performance backplane bus intended for use in multiple processor systems, the PSB incorporates synchronous, 32-bit multiplexed address/data, with error detection, and uses a 10 MHz bus clock. This design is intended to provide reliable state-of-the-art operation and to allow the implementation of cost-effective, high-performance VLSI for the bus interface. Memory, I/O, message, and geographic address spaces are defined. Error detection and retry are provided for messages. The message-passing design allows a VLSI implementation, so that virtually all modules on the bus will utilize the bus at its highest performance--32 to 40 Mbyte/s. An overview of PSB, signal descriptions, the PSB protocol, electrical characteristics, and mechanical specifications are covered.
networks The functions, features, protocol, and services of the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, which constitutes the top sublayer in the data link layer of the ISO/IEC 8802 Local Area Network Protocol, are described. The services required of, or by, the LLC sublayer at the logical interfaces with the network layer, the MAC sublayer, and the LLC sublayer management function are specified. The protocol data unit (PDU) structure for data communication systems is defined using bit-oriented procedures, as are three types of operation for data communication between service access points. In the first type of operation, PDUs are exchanged between LLCs without the need for the establishment of a data link connection. In the second type of operation, a data link connection is established between two LLCs prior to any exchange of information-bearing PDUs. In the third type of operation, PDUs are exchanged between LLCs without the need for the establishment of a data link connection, but stations are permitted to both send data and request the return of data simultaneously.

(The PDF of this standard is available at no cost compliments of the GETIEEE802 program located at http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.1.html)
systems It defines the Ada language bindings as package specifications and accompanying textual descriptions to the application program interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the source level through the binding between ISO 8652:1987 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1990) (POSIX). Terminology and general requirements, process primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input and output primitives, device- and class-specific functions, language-specific services for Ada, and system databases are covered. It also specifies behavior to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada compilation system. The emphasis in POSIX is on application programs, so the interfaces in this document are not sufficient to implement an Ada compilation system or a POSIX shell, nor is this standard meant to be sufficient for real-time applications.
system The interdisciplinary tasks, which are required throughout a system's life cycle to transform customer needs, requirements, and constraints into a system solution, are defined. In addition, the requirements for the systems engineering process and its application throughout the product life cycle are specified. The focus of this standard is on engineering activities necessary to guide product development while ensuring that the product is properly designed to make it affordable to produce, own, operate, maintain, and eventually to dispose of, without undue risk to health or the environment.
systems This standard defines elements and commonly used components in excitation systems and contains definitions for excitation systems applied to synchronous machines.

circuit This amendment includes special requirements better suited for generator circuit breakers used to protect smaller generators rated between 10 MVA and 50 MVA and between 50 MVA and 100 MVA. It is important because the existing standards for typical distribution circuit breakers specifically exclude generator circuit breakers from the scope.
interface This standard provides basic requirements, direction, and methods for qualifying class IE connection assemblies for service in nuclear power generating stations. These include connectors, terminations, and environmental seals in combination with related cables or wires as assemblies. Qualification of cable with connectors to this standard does not replace qualification to IEEE Std 383<sup>TM</sup>-2003. This standard does not apply to containment electric penetrations, fire stops, in-line splices, or components for service within the reactor vessel. The qualification requirements in this standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability of the equipment to perform safety function(s) under applicable service conditions (including design basis events) reducing the risks of common cause-equipment failures. This standard does not provide environmental stress levels and performance requirements.
software The standard provides criteria for the performance of periodic testing of nuclear power generating station safety systems. The scope of periodic testing consists of functional tests and checks, calibration verification, and time response measurements, as required, to verify that the safety system performs its defined safety function. Post-maintenance and post-modification testing are not covered by this document. This standard amplifies the periodic testing requirements of other nuclear safety-related IEEE standards.

system It is required that Class 1E motors, with their interfaces, meet or exceed the specified performance requirements throughout their service life. This is accomplished through a program that includes, but is not limited to, design, qualification, production quality control, shipping, storage, installation, operation, maintenance, periodic testing, and surveillance. This standard addresses the qualification portion of the program. It discusses the requirement for maintenance, repair, and surveillance of motors to maintain qualification of motors throughout their installed life but does not provide detailed guidance about how these programmatic items must be implemented and maintained. The qualification requirements of this standard, when met, demonstrate and document the ability of the motor and/or insulation system to perform its safety function(s) under specified service conditions.

Specifically, the multi-channel operation (channel coordination) provides mechanisms for prioritized access, channel routing and coordination, and data transmission.
management Revision of IEEE Std 1512.1-2003 This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about public safety and emergency management issues involved in transportation-related events, through common incident management message sets. The message sets specified are consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1 or ASN) syntax. This standard comprises the basic volume of the family of incident management standards, a multi-volume set of documents centered around this Base Standard. Other members of that family include three other companion volumes, specifying incident management message sets for transportation-management-related data exchange and hazardous-material- and cargo-related data exchange, etc. Collectively, that family of standards shall be referred to as the 1512 Family of Standards. The goal of that family of standards is to support efficient communication for the real-time, interagency management of transportationrelated events. Those events include incidents, emergencies, accidents, planned roadway closures, special events, and disasters caused by humans or natural events. Those events include any such event that impacts transportation systems or that causes a report to be received by an emergency management system, whether or not the event actually affects a transportation system and whether or not a response is required.

The switching devices shall be fused, drawout type, three-pole construction, with one or more rated maximum ac voltages of 600 V, 508 V, and 254 V for application on systems having nominal ac voltages of 600 V, 480 V, and 240 V. The switching devices are power operated with integral or separately mounted overcurrent protective devices. This standard addresses service conditions, ratings, functional components, temperature limitations and classifications of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application. The switching devices are normally used in applications that require frequency of operation greater than normal operations expected of low-voltage power circuit breakers.

Particular emphasis is placed on the International System of Units (Le SystemeInternational d'Unites, SI).
network IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003 defined the protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low-data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network (WPAN). This revision extends the market applicability of IEEE Std 802.15.4, removes ambiguities in the standard, and makes improvements revealed by implementations of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003. An Interpretation is available at http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/interps/802.15.4-2006.html

wireless This amendment provides corrections and optimizations to IEEE Std 802.15.3-2003. Themanagement service access points (SAPs) have been completely updated to create a consistent,logical interface. As a consequence, most of the message sequence charts (MSCs) in the mediumaccess control (MAC) functional specification have been updated as well. Channel time usage ismore efficient with the addition of multiple contention periods, releasing channel time, impliedacknowledgment, and mullticast groups.

wireless This standard represents the Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement Proforma, per ISO/IEC 9646-7 (1995) and ITU-T X.296, for conformance specification of base stations and subscriber stations based upon the WirelessMAN-SC air interface specified in IEEE 802.16.
systems This standard is the first in the 1547 series of interconnection standards and is a benchmark milestone demonstrating the open consensus process for standards development. Traditionally, utility electric power systems (EPS--grid or utility grid) were not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution level. As a result, there are major issues and obstacles to an orderly transition to using and integrating distributed power resources with the grid. The lack of uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical, and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements, rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547 has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests. The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of distributed resources (DR), including synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters and will be sufficient for most installations.
