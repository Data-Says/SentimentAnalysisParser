Outdoor and indoor composite station post insulators used in high-voltage direct-current power transmission systems are covered in this standard. The composite station post insulators covered by this standard consist of a load-bearing insulating core (or tube), a housing (outside the insulating solid core or tube) made of elastomer material (e.g., silicone or ethylene-propylene), and end fittings attached to the insulating core (or tube).
