The liquid-scintillation counter measures activity of radionuclides from the rate of light photons emitted by a liquid sample. The total light photon output from the sample is a function of the radionuclide(s) and the purity, type, and amount of various constituents that comprise the sample as well as the nature of the sample container used. Performance evaluation of a liquid-scintillation counting system, as outlined in ANSI N42.15-1980, requires the use of standardized check sources. This standard will provide specifications for such check sources.<<ETX>>
