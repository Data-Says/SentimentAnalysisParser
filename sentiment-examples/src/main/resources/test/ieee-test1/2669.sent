This standard defines a wireless interface for sensors. It specifies radio-specific protocols for this wireless interface. It defines communication modules that connect the wireless transducer interface module (WTIM) and the network-capable applications processor (NCAP) using the radio-specific protocols. It also defines the Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS) for the radio-specific protocols.
