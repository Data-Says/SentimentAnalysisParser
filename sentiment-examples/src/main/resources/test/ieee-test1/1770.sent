This specification defines the requirements for a single-degree-of-freedom rate-integrating gyro to be used as a sensor in systems such as an attitude control system, a gimbal platform, an angular displacement measuring system, or an angular rate measuring system. The external electronics or control system are not considered to be part of the gyro.<<ETX>>
