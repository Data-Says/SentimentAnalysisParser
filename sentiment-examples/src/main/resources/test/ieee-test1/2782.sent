This guide defines thermal limit curves, recommends a standard procedure for construction of the curves, and provides the definitions and information necessary to properly use these curves. The guide also describes thermal limit curves for large squirrel-cage motors defined as those motor ratings built in frames larger than the frame normally used for 500 hp, 1800 r/min motors.
