The scope of this document is the development of a common receiver/fixture interface (RFI) specification that is based upon available commercial standards integrated under a common "open" architecture. This mechanical/electrical interface is intended to serve government/commercial interest for applications in test, system integration, manufacturing, monitoring, and other functional requirements that demand large contact densities and quick-disconnect mechanical operation.
