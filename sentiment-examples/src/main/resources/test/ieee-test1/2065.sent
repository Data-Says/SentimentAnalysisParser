A new specification language, named Fuzzy Markup Language (FML), is presented in this standard, exploiting the benefits offered by eXtensible Markup Language (XML) specifications and related tools in order to model a fuzzy logic system in a human-readable and hardware independent way. Therefore, designers of industrial fuzzy systems are provided with a unified and high-level methodology for describing interoperable fuzzy systems. The W3C XML Schema definition language is used by this standard to define the syntax and semantics of the FML programs.
