Most of the test methods described include specific parameter ranges, instrument accuracies, core sizes, etc, and may be used in the specification of magnetic cores for industrial and military applications. Other sections of the standard describe more generalized test procedures and are included more for the benefit of the R and D engineer and university student than as tests for specifying core characteristics. A few of these general discussions represent areas in which the technology was relatively new, such as the measurement of core loss in nonsinusoidal systems, and no trend towards a certain standardized technique was apparent at the time of preparation. This standard is aimed toward test methods used on relatively small cores as in the electronics, controls, and computer industries.<<ETX>>
