This list of standard laser-maser terms had its inception in the work of Subcommittee 28.7 of the IEEE Standards Committee. For various reasons work on these standards was suspended for a time. In 1970, with agreement of the Groups on Electron Devices and Microwave Theory and Techniques, work resumed under the aegis of the IEEE Council on Quantum Electronics. For convenience, terms from ANSI 2136.1-1973, American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers, have been inserted in this list where appropriate.
