Formal models for information used in system diagnosis are defined. As part of the AI-ESTATE (Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to All Test Environments) set of standards, this standard includes several models that form the basis for a format to facilitate the exchange of persistent diagnostic information between two reasoners, and also provides a formal typing system for the services defined in the AI-ESTATE service specification.
