A worldwide standard for narrowband power line communications (PLC) via alternating current, direct current, and nonenergized electric power lines using frequencies below 500 kHz. Data rates of up to 500 kb/s are supported. The field of use includes Smart Grid applications. Coexistence mechanisms that can be used by other PLC technologies operating below 500 kHz are also included. These coexistence mechanisms may be used separately from the rest of the standard.
