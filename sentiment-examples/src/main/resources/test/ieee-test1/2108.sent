The standard provides a standardized interface for accessing the system services of ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1990 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, also known as POSIX.1), and support routines to access constructs not directly accessible with FORTRAN 77. This standard supports application portability at the source level through the binding between ANSI X3.9-1978 and POSIX.1, and a standardized definition of language-specific services. The goal is to provide standardized interfaces to the POSIX.1 system services via a FORTRAN 77 language interface. Terminology and general requirements, process primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input and output primitives, device- and class-specific functions, the FORTRAN 77 language library, and system databases are covered.<<ETX>>
