ALF is a modeling language for library elements used in IC technology. ALF enables de-scription of electrical, functional, and physical models in a formal language suitable for electronic design automation (EDA) application tools targeted for design and analysis of an IC. This standard provides rules that describe ALF and how tool developers, integrators, library creators, and library users should use it.
