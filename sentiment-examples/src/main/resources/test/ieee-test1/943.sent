Directions for establishing an acceptable pre-operational testing program for Class 1E power systems in nuclear power generating stations are provided. The pre-operational tests are performed after the appropriate construction tests have been completed. Their purpose is to verify that the Class 1E power systems perform their required function as designed. The power systems are considered to include the ac and dc power supplies, but do not include the equipment that utilizes the power.
