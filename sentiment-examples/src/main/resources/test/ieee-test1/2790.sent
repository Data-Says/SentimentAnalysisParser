This standard describes parameters and methods of measurement suitable for the characterization of varactors intended for large-signal application. This will be done by reference to the parameters and methods prescribed in IEEE Std 318-1971, Trial-Use Guide on Solid-State Devices: Varactor Measurements, Part I - Small Signal Measurements, where they are applicable, and by modification and supplementation of them where necessary for use with large-signal devices.
