This standard applies to devices (other than surge arresters) used for the purpose of controlling the ground current or the potentials to ground of alternating current systems. It defines usual and unusual service conditions, and gives bases for rating such devices. Specifications are given for temperature limitations, dielectric tests, routine tests, losses and impedance measurements, and construction items
