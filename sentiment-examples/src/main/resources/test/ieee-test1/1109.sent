Guidance in the protection of stationary battery systems is provided. For the purposes of this guide, stationary battery systems include the battery and DC components to and including the first protective device downstream of the battery terminals. This guide does not set requirements; rather, it presents a number of options to the DC system designer of the different types of stationary battery system protection available.
