Information to assist in determining the electrical parameters of communication and control cables necessary to improve the overall reliability of these cables when used in high-voltage environments is the objective of this standard. There should be a very high probability (greater than 99%) that these cables will perform their intended function for specified periods of time in high-voltage interference conditions. The end result being more reliable communications over said cables. The information presented in this standard will apply equally to either new or existing [already installed] cables.
