Software verification and validation (V&V) processes determine whether the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity and whether the software satisfies its intended use and user needs. Software V&V life cycle process requirements are specified for different software integrity levels. The scope of V&V processes encompasses software-based systems, computer software, hardware, and interfaces. This standard applies to software being developed, maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental items]. The term software also includes firmware, microcode, and documentation. Software V&V processes include analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing of software products
