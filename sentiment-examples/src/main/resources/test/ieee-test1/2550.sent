This standard provides uniform and minimum requirements for the format and content of Software Verification and Validation Plans (SVVPs). Performing software verification and validation (V and V) as defined in this standard provides for a comprehensive evaluation throughout each phase of the software project to help ensure that: errors are detected and corrected as early as possible in the software life cycle, project risk, cost, and schedule effects are lessened, software quality and reliability are enhanced, management visibility into the software process is improved, proposed changes and their consequences can be quickly assessed. This standard applies to both critical and noncritical software.<<ETX>>
