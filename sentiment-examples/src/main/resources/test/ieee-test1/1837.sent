In this IEEE Standard instructions for conducting and reporting the more generally applicable and acceptable tests to determine the performance characteristics of polyphase induction motors having liquid in the magnetic gap are given. Constants in several equations and forms apply to three-phase motors only and require modification for application to motors having another number of phases.
