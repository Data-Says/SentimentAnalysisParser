In this IEEE standard a test procedure for comparing expected life, at rated temperature, of two or more sealed insulation systems, is outlined. The procedure is limited to insulation systems for AC electric machines using random-wound stator coils. It is the intent of this procedure to evaluate insulation systems for use with air cooling under severe environmental conditions where the insulation is exposed to conducting contaminants. It does not cover special requirements such as those for machines enclosed in gas atmospheres, subjected to strong chemicals, or to submersion in liquids.
