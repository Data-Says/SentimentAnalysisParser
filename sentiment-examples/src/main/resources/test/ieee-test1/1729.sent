This standard applies to shunts for use in direct current circuits to extend the range of instruments or other measuring devices. This standard may apply with suitable exceptions to shunts constructed for special requirements; for example, those having unusually high or low current ratings or voltage drops, special or unusual ranges, and nonstandard terminal arrangements for special applications.<<ETX>>
