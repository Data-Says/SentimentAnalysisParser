The IEEE Property Specification Language (PSL) is defined in this standard. PSL is a formal notation for specification of electronic system behavior, compatible with multiple electronic system design languages, including IEEE Std 1076trade (VHDL<sup>reg</sup>), IEEE Std 1364trade (Verilog<sup>reg</sup>), IEEE P1666trade (SystemC<sup>reg</sup>), and IEEE P1800trade (SystemVerilog<sup>reg</sup>), thereby enabling a common specification and verification flow for multi-language and mixed-language designs. PSL captures design intent in a form suitable for simulation, formal verification, formal analysis, and hybrid verification tools. PSL enhances communication among architects, designers, and verification engineers to increase productivity throughout the design and verification process. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementors of tools supporting the language and advanced users of the language.
