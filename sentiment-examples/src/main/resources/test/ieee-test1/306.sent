This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2002, as amended by IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002, IEEE Std 802.3af-2003 and IEEE Std 802.3aj-2003, specifies a new physical layer medium dependent sublayer interface for 10 Gb/s Ethernet. 10GBASE-CX4 specifies an equipment interconnect based on the 10 gigabit attachment unit interface (XAUI) for up to 15 m of balanced shielded cabling. The media access control (MAC) protocol specified in IEEE Std 802.3 is carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). This MAC protocol was included in the experimental Ethernet developed at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. While the experimental Ethernet had a 2.94 Mb/s data rate, IEEE Std 802.3-1985 specified operation at 10 Mb/s. Since 1985 new media options, new speeds of operation, and new protocol capabilities have been added to IEEE Std 802.3.
