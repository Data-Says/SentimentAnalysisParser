Testing, calibration, and calibration frequency requirements for portable radiation detectors used to directly measure alpha, beta, photon, and neutron radiation are defined. Also defined are the calibration and testing requirements for alpha and beta-gamma measurements of surface contamination levels using portable radiation detectors. Portable radiation detectors may be battery or line powered.
