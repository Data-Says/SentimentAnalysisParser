Conformance test requirements are provided for current and inductively-coupled voltage transformers used for measurement and control functions in unit substations at primary system voltages above 600 V, but not exceeding 38 kV, except for those in certain installations as set forth in the standard. The selection of transformers for conformance testing, the basis for conformance, and the treatment of failures within a test sequence are covered. Impulse, voltage-withstand, accuracy, and temperature rise are specified. Insulation systems acceptance and production monitoring are considered.<<ETX>>
