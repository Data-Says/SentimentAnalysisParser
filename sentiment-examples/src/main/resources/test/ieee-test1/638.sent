Methods for determining antenna factors of antennas used for radiated emission measurements of electromagnetic interference (EMI) from 9 kHz to 40 GHz are provided. Antennas included are linearly polarized antennas such as loops, rods (monopoles), tuned dipoles, biconical dipoles, log-periodic dipole arrays, hybrid linearly polarized arrays, broadband horns, etc., which are used in measurements governed by ANSI C63.4-2001. The methods include standard site (i.e. 3-antenna), reference antenna, equivalent capacitance substitution, standard transmitting loop, standard antenna, and standard field methods.
