This standard defines the test method specifications for IEEE Std 1003.b-1993 (basedon the document corresponding to the merger of IEEE Std 1003.1-1990 and IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993). The test method specifications consist of assertions to be tested and related test procedures.As an amendment to IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, this standard is structured to amend those portions of IEEE Std 2003.1-1992 (the test method specification for IEEE Std 1003.1-1990) that correspond to the amended parts of IEEE Std 1003.1-1990. This standard is aimed primarily at providers of test methods for IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993 and at implementors of IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993.
