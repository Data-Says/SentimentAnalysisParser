50 Hz or 60 Hz synchronous generators driven by diesel engines, steam turbines, combustion gas turbines, and hydro-turbines are covered in this guide. The drive may be direct or through a gear box or other device that permits different speeds for the prime mover and the generator. The guide generally applies to the stator and rotor of generators with rated outputs of 1 MVA and above. The guide does not address machine auxiliaries or the excitation system. This guide will provide the generator Owner with insight into the considerations that are necessary when rewinding or refurbishing a generator. Particular emphasis is placed on the complete rewind of the stator and rotor.
