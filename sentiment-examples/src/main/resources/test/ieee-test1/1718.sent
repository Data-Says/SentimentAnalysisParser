This standard defines ANSI Standard Real-Time BASIC, in which the declarations and real-time statements are defined for use with CAMAC hardware. It covers real-time capabilities, declarations, parallel activities, CAMAC input and output, the CAMAC Q and X signals, CAMAC LAM handling, message passing, shared data, and bit manipulation. The aim is to achieve maximum compatibility between different implementations of ANSI BASIC for use with CAMAC.
