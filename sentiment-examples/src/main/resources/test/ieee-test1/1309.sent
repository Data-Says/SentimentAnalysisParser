The IEEE Emerald Book(TM) presents a collection of consensus best practices for thepowering and grounding of electronic equipment used in commercial and industrial applications.The main objective is to provide consensus recommended practices in an area where conflictinginformation and conflicting design philosophies have dominated. The recommended practicesdescribed are intended to enhance equipment performance while maintaining a safe installation. Adescription of the nature and origin of power disturbances is provided, followed by theory on thevarious parameters that impact power quality. Information on quantifying and resolving power andgrounding related concerns using measurement and diagnostic instrumentation and standardizedinvestigative procedures are included. Recommended power protection equipment and wiring andgrounding system design practices are presented. Information on telecommunications systempower protection as well as grounding, industrial system grounding, and noise control is included.Finally a selection of case studies are presented to support the recommended practices presentedthroughout the book.
