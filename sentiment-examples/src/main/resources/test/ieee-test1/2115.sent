This amendment is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications and user interfaces to open systems. The purpose of this project is to specify a set of interfaces to allow portable access to underlying trace management services by application programs. These underlying services provide access to streams of event data, where the events can be generated by software and/or hardware, either from the application or the operating system. This standard is stated in terms of its C language binding.
