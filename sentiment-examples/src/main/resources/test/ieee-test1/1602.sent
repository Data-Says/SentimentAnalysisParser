This IEEE standard defines a modular data-bus system for data acquisition and control. Mechanical, signal, electrical, and protocol specifications are given that are sufficient to assure compatibility between units from different sources of design and production. This standard applies to systems consisting of modular electronic instrument units that process or transfer data or signals, normally in association with computers or other automatic data processors.<<ETX>>
