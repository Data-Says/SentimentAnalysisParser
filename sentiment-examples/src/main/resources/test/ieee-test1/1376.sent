In this IEEE standard a test procedure for comparing two or more sealed insulation systems in accordance with their expected life at rated temperature is outlined. The procedure is limited to insulation systems for alternating-current (AC) electrical machines using form-wound preinsulated stator coils rated 6900 V and below
