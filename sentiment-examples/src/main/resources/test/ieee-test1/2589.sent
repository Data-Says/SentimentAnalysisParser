In this standard transformers of both the saturating and nonsaturating type are covered. The power transfer capability of the transformers and inductors covered range from the minimal (less than 1 W) to the multikilowatt level. The purpose is to provide a common basis for the engineers designing the transformers and inductors used in those activities. The transformers are used in inverters, converters, power conditioners, switching power supplies, switch mode power supplies and other similar equipment.<<ETX>>
