The IEEE Std 488-1978, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, deals with systems that use a byte-serial bit-parallel means to transfer digital data among a group of instruments and system components. The interface system described herein is optimized as an interdevice interface for system components in relatively close proximity able to communicate over a contiguous party-line bus system. This document contains seven sections as follows. Section 1 contains the scope, the object, basic definitions, and summary description of the interface. Section 2 deals with functional concepts and specifications of the interface system described in this standard. One or more interface functions contained within a device are each able to process messages and change states to maintain an orderly flow of information among a set of interconnected devices. Section 3 deals with the electrical realization of the interface in order to transfer messages among a set of interconnected devices. Section 4 deals with the mechanical realization of the interface in order to implement the electrical aspects of the interface system.
