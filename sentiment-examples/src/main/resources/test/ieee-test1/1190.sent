A wide variety of block transfer algorithms (or modes) are possible in CAMAC systems. However, a restricted number of such algorithms can satisfy nearly all needs. This document presents recommended algorithms to encourage uniformity in design of CAMAC modules and controllers with resulting increased compatibility. It should be read in conjunction with, and is supplementary to, IEEE Standards 583-1975, Modular Instrumentation and Digital Interface System, 595-1976, Serial Highway Interface Systems, and 596-1976, Parallel Highway Interface System (CAMAC).<<ETX>>
