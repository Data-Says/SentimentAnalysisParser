Environmental testing requirements are defined for communications networking devices to be installed in transmission and distribution facilities. This standard establishes a common reproducible basis for designing and evaluating devices utilizing radio frequency (RF) upto 6 GHz, power line communications, and broadband over power line (BPL) technologies. It also requires immunity to five IEC electromagnetic compatibility standards for which there are no IEEE equivalent standards. This standard is an extension to IEEE Std 1613�ܢ-2009 and IEEE Std1613a�ܢ-2011.
