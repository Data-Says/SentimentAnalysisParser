This standard provides definitions and descriptions of the techniques and procedures for time domain pulse measurements. The definitions and descriptions provided are independent of specific devices, apparatus, instruments, or computing devices which may be used in pulse measurements and are prerequisite to: efficient communication of the results of pulse measurements; standards for pulse apparatus; and standards for apparatus which employs pulse techniques. Within its scope, the object of this standard is the definition of terms and the description of techniques and procedures which are applicable to the determination of the characteristics of practical and hypothetical pulses regardless of accuracy or precision. The standard relates to a wide range of technologies and disciplines.<<ETX>>
