This standard describes heterogeneous networks convergence and scalability, specifies the requirements of network convergence, extends the system architecture defined in IEEE Std 1888(TM), IEEE Standard for Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network Protocol, with two new IEEE 1888(TM) Components, i.e., the reconfigurable resolution server (RRS) and the intelligent application resolver (IAR), and generalizes primitive data type expressions and explicit field-bus data type management in IEEE 1888 systems. This standard enables IEEE 1888 systems to interoperate with heterogeneous access networks efficiently and improves the efficiency, flexibility, scalability and manageability of IEEE 1888 systems.
