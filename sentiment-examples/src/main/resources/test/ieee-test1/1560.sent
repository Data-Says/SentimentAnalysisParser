The purpose of this standard is to provide uniformity in the terms used in the field of corona and radio noise. It defines the most widely used terms specific to or associated with overhead power-line corona and radio noise. The terms and definitions are split into four categories: ionisation processes and parameters; communication; measurements; and propagation.<<ETX>>
