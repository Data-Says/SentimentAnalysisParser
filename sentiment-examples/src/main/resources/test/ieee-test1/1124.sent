The guide provides the conceptual insights, implementation considerations, and assessment suggestions for the application of IEEE Std 982.1-1988, IEEE Standard Dictionary of Measures to Produce Reliable Software. The Dictionary, by its very nature, is limited in what it may contain. While this is necessary for standardization, abbreviation of detail might be detrimental to the most effective use of the Dictionary. The guide is written to provide a bridge between IEEE Std 982.1-1988 and the user, so that full benefit may be derived from the application of the standard to a software project.<<ETX>>
