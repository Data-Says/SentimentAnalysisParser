This standard describes methods for qualifying static battery chargers and inverters for Class 1E installations in environmentally controlled areas outside containment in nuclear power generating stations. For the purpose of this standard, battery chargers and inverters must perform their intended function under specified service conditions. The demonstration that an installed battery charger or inverter will meet its design specification requires many steps in a program of design, fabrication, quality control, qualification, installation, maintenance, and periodic testing. This standard treats only the qualification area of this program. The result may provide a basis for determination of long term maintenance requirements. Qualification may be accomplished in several ways: type testing, operating experience, or analysis.<<ETX>>
