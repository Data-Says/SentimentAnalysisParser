This specification defines the requirements for a linear, single-axis, pendulous, analog torque balance accelerometer. The instrument is equipped with a permanent magnet torquer and is used as a sensing element to provide an electrical signal proportional to acceleration. The torque balance electronics are not considered to be part of the instrument.
