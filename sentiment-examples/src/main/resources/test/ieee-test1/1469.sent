This standard is applicable to fire stops of various materials and construction. Cable-penetration fire stops are intended for use in fire-resistive barriers. Tests conducted in conformance with this standard will record the performance of fire stops during the test exposure. The resistance of a fire stop to an external force imposed by a hose stream or water spray will also be considered in this standard. The intent of this standard is to develop data to assist in determining the suitability of a fire stop for use where fire resistance is required.
