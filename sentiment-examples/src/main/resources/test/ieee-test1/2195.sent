IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003 defined the protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low-data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wireless personal area network (WPAN). This revision extends the market applicability of IEEE Std 802.15.4, removes ambiguities in the standard, and makes improvements revealed by implementations of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003.
