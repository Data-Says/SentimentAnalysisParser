Foundations for transmission structures are subjected to unique loading conditions in which a high portion of the load is transitory and involves high uplift forces or high overturning moments with little vertical loading. Information concerning the design of foundations subjected to such loading conditions has not been readily available to designers in a single document. Thus, the objective of this guide is to provide in a single source available information on design methods for foundation design engineers. The information contained in this guide covers the modes of foundation loads for various types of transmission structures; the scope of subsurface investigations; alternate methods for designing spread foundations, drilled shafts, pile foundations, and anchors; and procedures for conducting load tests.<<ETX>>
