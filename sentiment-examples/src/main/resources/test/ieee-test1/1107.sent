This guide covers protection of shunt reactors used typically to compensate for capacitive shunt reactance of transmission lines. A survey of shunt reactor protection, conducted in 1979 by the Shunt Reactor Protection Working Group of the IEEE Power System Relaying Committee, was used as a reference to determine the more common circuit arrangements and protective relaying schemes in use. Other arrangements or special applications of reactors such as harmonic filter banks, static VAR compensation (SVC), high voltage direct current (HVDC), or current-limiting reactors are not specifically addressed; however, the protective methods described in this guide are usually applicable to this equipment.<<ETX>>
