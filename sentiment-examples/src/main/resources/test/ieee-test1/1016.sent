Insulation is recognized as one of the most important constructional elements of a transformer. Its chief function is to confine the current to useful paths, preventing its flow into harmful channels. Any weakness of insulation may result in failure of the transformer. A measure of the effectiveness with which insulation performs is the dielectric strength. The standard covers impulse testing for transformers. Techniques, impulse wave shapes, an impulse test circuit, impulse voltage measurement, grounding practices, failure detection, nonimpulsed terminals connection, impulse generator size and interpretation of impulse tests are covered. Also included are nonlinear devices, ground current traces, impulse waveform examples and methods of presenting test results.<<ETX>>
