The purpose of this standard is to specify a common set of modeling concepts based on those found in commercial CASE tools for describing the operational behavior of a software product. This standard establishes a uniform, integrated model of software concepts related to software functionality. It also provides a textual syntax for expressing the common properties (attributes and relationships) of those concepts as they have been used to model software behavior. The 1175.3 exchange syntax is both machine-processable and human-readable.
