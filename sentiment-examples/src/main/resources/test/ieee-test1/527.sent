This standard was developed in response to a need created by the rapid expansion of underground distribution systems. A key element which allowed this expansion to become a reality is the separable insulated connector. This device provides for simple and inexpensive connection and switching to transformers and other equipment used in underground distribution.This standard establishes definitions, electrical ratings, tests, and interchangeable construction features for load-break and dead-break separable insulated connectors rated 601 V and above, 600 A or less, for use on power distribution systems.
