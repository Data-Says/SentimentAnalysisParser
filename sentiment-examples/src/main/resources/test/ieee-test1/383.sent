This standard is a revision of Part II of 50 IRE23.S1, and replaces it in all respects. One of the major characteristics of a television system affecting overall picture quality is the ability of the system to reproduce fine detail found in the original image. This ability to resolve detail is determined by a number of factors, such as the number of scanning lines employed, the frame repetition rate, and the overall response of the electrical circuits, which is usually specified in terms of the frequency-response characteristics. Performance of the optical imaging device, the camera tube and the reproducing device also has considerable influence on the ability of the system to resolve detail.<<ETX>>
