IEEE 1613 is the IEEE standard for the environmental and testing requirements for communications networking devices in electric power substations. Service conditions, electrical ratings, thermal ratings, and environmental testing requirements are defined for communications networking devices to be installed in electric power substations. Examples of these devices include radios, encryption devices, port switches, autodialers, modems, Ethernet hubs and switches, routers, gateways, and firewalls. This standard establishes a common reproducible basis for designing and evaluating communications networking devices for use in this harsh environment.
