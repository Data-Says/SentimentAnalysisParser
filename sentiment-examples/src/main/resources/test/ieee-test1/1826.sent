It is the purpose of this standard to provide a procedure for determining certain operating characteristics of carbon, carbon-graphite, electrographite, graphite, and metal-graphite brushes under prescribed test conditions for all types of rotating AC and DC motors and similar apparatus. The operating characteristics covered in this standard are: voltage drop, coefficient of friction, wear ratio as affected by low humidity, and commutating ability.<<ETX>>
