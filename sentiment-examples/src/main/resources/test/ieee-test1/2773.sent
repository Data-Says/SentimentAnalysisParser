The intent of this Test Procedure is to establish a uniform method by which the life of electronics transformer insulation systems can be compared. Thermal degradation is generally one of the major factors affecting the life of most insulating materials. It was chosen to be the major environmental factor in this Test Procedure. Other environmental factors, such as vibration,thermal shock, and moisture, have been included to simulate operating conditions. These factors have been chosen in such a way as to develop and disclose promptly any significant weaknesses during the temperature aging of an insulation system.
