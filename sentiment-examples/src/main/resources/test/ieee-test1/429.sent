Standard Test Interface Language (STIL) provides an interface between digital test generationtools and test equipment. A test description language is defined that: (a) facilitates the transferof digital test vector data from CAE to ATE environments; (b) specifies pattern, format, andtiming information sufficient to define the application of digital test vectors to a DUT; and (c) supportsthe volume of test vector data generated from structured tests.
