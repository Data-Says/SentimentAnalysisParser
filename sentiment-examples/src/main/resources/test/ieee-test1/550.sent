This standard specifies the data format that shall be used for both required and optional data to be made available by radiation instruments for homeland security applications. The performance for these types of instruments is described in other standards; such as ANSI/IEEE N42.32, ANSI/IEEE N42.33, ANSI/IEEE N42.34, ANSI/IEEE N42.35, and ANSI/IEEE N42.38.
