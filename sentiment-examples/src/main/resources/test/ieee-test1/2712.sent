The purpose of this Standard is to make possible the comparison of the relative merits of magnetostrictive, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and electrostrictive transducers on a simple and straightforward basis. The nomenclature used has evolved from a proposed set of definitions for the parameters used in evaluating magnetostrictive materials. In the literature, the symbol ' lambda ' has been widely used for the magnetostriction constant, the saturation magnetostrictive strain, or occasionally, the slope of some other curve associated with magnetostrictive measurement. No quantity is represented by ' lambda ' in this standard.<<ETX>>
