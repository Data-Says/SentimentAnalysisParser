The scope of this standard is to set forth the basic data on magnetic amplifier core materials that should be presented by manufacturers of core materials so that the magnetic amplifier designer will have available the parameters of the material particularly significant to magnetic amplifier design. The tests proposed in this standard are not intended as methods of matching and grading magnetic amplifier cores.
