In this IEEE Standard, criteria that establish protection requirements for Class 1E power systems and equipment are prescribed. The purpose of and the means for obtaining protection from electrical and mechanical damage or failures that can occur within a time period that is shorter than that required for operator action are described. Testing and surveillance requirements are included. Plant physical design requirements to protect against certain events are not included.
