The SystemC<sup>��</sup> Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) extensions are defined in this standard. SystemC AMS is an ANSI standard C++ class library for electronic system-level design and modeling for use by system architects and engineers who need to address complex heterogeneous systems that are a hybrid between analog, digital and software components. This standard provides a precise and complete definition of the SystemC AMS class library so that a SystemC AMS implementation can be developed with reference to this standard alone. The primary audiences for this standard are the implementors of the SystemC AMS class library, the implementors of tools supporting the class library, and the users of the class library.
