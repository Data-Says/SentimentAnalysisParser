The specification and test requirements for a single-axis laser gyro for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems is defined. A standard specification format guide for the preparation of a single-axis laser gyro is provided. A complication of recommended procedures for testing a laser gyro, derived from those presently used in the industry, is also provided.
