The definition of the language syntax and semantics for SystemVerilog, which is a unified hardware design, specification, and verification language, is provided. This standard includes support for modeling hardware at the behavioral, register transfer level (RTL), and gate-level abstraction levels, and for writing testbenches using coverage, assertions, object-oriented programming, and constrained random verification. The standard also provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to foreign programming languages.
