This standard defines the IEEE 1076.1 language, a hardware description language for the description and the simulation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal systems. The language, also informally known as VHDL-AMS, is built on IEEE Std 1076trade-2002 (VHDL) and extends it with additions and changes to provide capabilities of writing and simulating analog and mixed-signal models.
