This IEEE standard has been written to fill a need for standardization of terminology and test requirements for permanent grounding connections used in substations. Many types of connectors are available that may be used as permanent grounding connections even though they were designed for use as power connectors. This standard has been written to provide a meaningful reproducible test program that will enable connector manufacturers to qualify their products as permanent grounding connections. The users can then be reasonably assured that the qualified permanent grounding connection will be capable of performing satisfactorily over the lifetime of the substation or other installation. This standard addresses the parameters for testing grounding connections on aluminium copper, steel, copper-clad steel, galvanized steel, and stainless-clad steel. This standard particularly addresses the connectors used within the grid system, connectors used to join ground leads to the grid system, and connectors used to join the ground leads to equipment and structures.<<ETX>>
