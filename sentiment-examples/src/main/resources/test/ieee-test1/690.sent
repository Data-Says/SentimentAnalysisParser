This standard applies to all low-voltage power circuit breakers of the 600-volt insulation class capable of interrupting short-circuit currents in excess of 10,000 amp (amperes) for use with ac circuits. Other low-voltage power circuit breakers for use on circuits rated up to 1,000 volts ac and 3,000 volts dc are not covered by this standard; molded-case circuit breakers are specifically not covered.
