Directions and requirements are provided for the conversion of qualified power switchgear equipment. Examples such as low-voltage power circuit breakers; high-voltage outdoor and medium-voltage indoor drawout power circuit breakers; low- and medium-voltage fused contactors; low- and medium-voltage ground and test devices; medium-voltage fused load interrupter switches; and all metal-enclosed switchgear are covered. Existing design standards are referenced with appropriate guidance on design testing necessary to design-verify the conversions. Reconditioning, which concerns the maintenance of existing equipment without alteration, is not covered.
