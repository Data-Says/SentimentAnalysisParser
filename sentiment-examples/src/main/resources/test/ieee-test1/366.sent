This standard represents an extension to the IEEE 1505 receiver fixture interface (RFI) standard specification. Particular emphasis is placed on defining within the IEEE 1505 RFI standard a more specific set of performance requirements that employ a common scalable: (a) pin map configuration; (b) specific connector modules; (c) respective contacts; (d) recommended switching implementation; and (e) legacy automatic test equipment (ATE) transitional devices. This is intentionally done to standardize the footprint and assure mechanical and electrical interoperability between past and future automatic test systems (ATS).
