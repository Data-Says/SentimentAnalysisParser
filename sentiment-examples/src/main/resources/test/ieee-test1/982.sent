Monitoring and measurement of battery parameters is an important element of maintaining a fully operational battery system. This guide presents and discusses measurable parameters of batteries used in stationary battery systems and the utilization of such observations. This guide does not give a listing of commercially available systems, but it does provide a means of establishing specifications for the desired parameters monitored
