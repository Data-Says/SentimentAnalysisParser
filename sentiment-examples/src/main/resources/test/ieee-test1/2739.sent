The scope of this IEEE standard is to develop an ISLAN (integrated services LAN) interface at the medium access control (MAC) sublayer and the Physical (PHY) layer compatible with IEEE 802.x and ISDN standards and architectures; develop an ISLAN interface that operates independently from the backbone network; focus upon unshielded twisted-pair wiring as the primary distribution medium; enable implementation of IS terminal equipment (ISTE) that accesses IEEE 802 LAN and ISDN services through a common interface
