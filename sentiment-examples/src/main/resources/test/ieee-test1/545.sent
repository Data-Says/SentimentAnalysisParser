This standard establishes methods for calibration and usage of germanium detectors for the measurement of gamma-ray emission rates of radionuclides. It covers the energy and full-energy peak efficiency calibration as well as the determination of gamma-ray energies in the 0.06 to 2 MeV energy region and is designed to yield gamma-ray emission rates with an uncertainty of +or-3 percent. This standard applies primarily to measurements which do not involve overlapping peaks, and in which peak to continuum considerations are not important.<<ETX>>
