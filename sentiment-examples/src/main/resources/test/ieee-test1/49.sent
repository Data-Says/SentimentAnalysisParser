This standard covers certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics, and takes into consideration certain safety features of single-phase, 60-Hz, mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, pad-mounted, compartmental-type distribution transformers with separable insulated high-voltage connectors. These transformers are rated 167 kVA and smaller, with high voltages of 34500 GrdY/19 920 volts and below for operation between one phase and grounded neutral, and low voltages of 240/120 volts. These transformers are generally used for step-down purposes from an underground primary cable supply.
