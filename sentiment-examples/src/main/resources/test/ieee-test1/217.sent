Close cooperation of committees of the International Electrotechnical Commission, the International Organization for Standardization, and the SUN Commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, together with effective liaison with committees of national standardizing organizations, is resulting in compatible national standards for letter symbols for both quantities and units. SI units are clearly identified, and the most recent (1978) actions of the International Committee for Weights and Measures have been incorporated. An important new section in this revision provides guidance for unit symbols to be used with limited character sets. There are important considerations in the man-machine interface area that are the subject of continued study by the preparing subcommittee.<<ETX>>
