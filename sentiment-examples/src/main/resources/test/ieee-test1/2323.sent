This amendment defines a physical layer for IEEE Std 802.15.4(TM)-2015, capable of supporting 2 Mb/s data rates, utilizing the 2400-2483.5 MHz band, having backwards-compatibility to, and the same occupied bandwidth as, the present 2450 MHz O-QPSK physical layer, and capable of simple implementation. Target range should be at least 10 meters. This amendment defines modifications to the medium access control (MAC) sublayer needed to support this new physical layer.
