This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1Q, 1998 Edition describes enhancements to allow for classification of incoming packets by methods other than source port. Specifically, it defines rules for classification based on data-link layer protocol identification. The document identifies proposed changes to the text of IEEE Std 802.1Q, 1998 Edition that have arisen as a consequence of this activity. These are documented in the usual form for amendments to IEEE 802/sup (R)/ standards; i.e., as an explicit set of editing instructions that, if correctly applied to the text of IEEE Std 802.1Q, 1998 Edition, will create a corrected document.
