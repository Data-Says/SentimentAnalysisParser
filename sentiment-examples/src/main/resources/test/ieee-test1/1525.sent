The two standards, IEEE Std 279-1971 (ANSI N42.7-1972), Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, and IEEE Std 308-1974, Standard Criteria for Class IE Power Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations, establish minimum requirements for the Class IE power and protection systems for nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power generation. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the capability for testing the Class IE power and protection systems. To develop tests and establish test procedures, an expansion and interpretation of the test capabilities specified in IEEE Std 279-1971 and IEEE Std 308-1974 are necessary.
