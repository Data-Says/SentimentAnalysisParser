ISO and IEEE 11073 standards enable communication between medical devices and external computersystems. This standard and corresponding IEEE 11073-104zz standards address a need for a simplified and optimized communication approach for personal health devices, which may or may not be regulateddevices. These standards align with, and draw upon, the existing clinically focused standards to provide easy management of data from either a clinical or personal health device.This document addresses a need for an openly defined, independent standard for converting the collected information into an interoperable transmission format so the information can be exchanged between agents and managers.
