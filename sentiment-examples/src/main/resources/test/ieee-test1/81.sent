Recommendations are provided for the in-service use, care, maintenance, and electrical testing of conductive clothing, including suits, gloves, socks and boots, for use on voltages up to 765 kV AC and /spl plusmn/750 kV DC. Testing pertains only to nondestructive electrical tests that can be performed periodically to check if there is any reduction in the conductivity of the clothing.
