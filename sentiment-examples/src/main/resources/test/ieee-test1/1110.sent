Wire-line communication facilities serving electric power stations often require special high-voltage protection against the effects of fault-produced ground potential rise or induction voltages, or both. Some of the communication services are used for control and protective relaying purposes which may be called upon to perform critical operations during periods of these faults. This constitutes a major problem in the design of the communications system since power system faults usually result in the introduction of interfering voltages and currents into the communication circuit just at the time when the latter is most urgently required to perform its function. This IEEE guide presents workable methods for protecting wire-line communication circuits entering power stations. It is important to note that special high-voltage protection for the purpose of personnel safety and plant protection may be required even when critical services are not involved. In the case of leased circuits mutually agreeable methods for the installation of protective equipment owned by either party are presented.<<ETX>>
