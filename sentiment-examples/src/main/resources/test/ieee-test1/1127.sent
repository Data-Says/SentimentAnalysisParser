This guide describes the electromagnetic threat posed to electronic equipment and subassemblies by actual electrostatic discharge (ESD) events from humans and mobile furnishings. This guide organizes existing data on the subject of ESD in order to charaterize the ESD surge environment. This guide is not an ESD test standard. It is intended to be a resource for equipment designers, and for preparers and users of ESD test standards. The manufacturing, handling, packaging, and transportation of individual electronic components, including integrated circuits, are not discussed, and this guide does not deal with mobile items such as automobiles, aircraft, and other masses of comparable size.
