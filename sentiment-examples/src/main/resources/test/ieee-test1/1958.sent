This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about transportation-related incidents among emergency management centers through common incident management message sets. Message sets specified are consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One syntax. This standard comprises the base standard of a family of incident management standards; specific incident management message sets for traffic, public safety, and HAZMAT centers may be found in forthcoming companion volumes which build upon and augment this base standard.
