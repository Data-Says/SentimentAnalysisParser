This IEEE standard presents a recommended set of software subroutines for use with the CAMAC modular instrumentation and interface system of IEEE Std 583-1975. These subroutines provide a general capability for communicating with CAMAC systems. They will be of primary interest to those who wish to write their own data-processing programs in a high-level programming language, such as Fortran. The achievable data transfer rate is, of course, dependent on a number of factors, including the language used, the operating system, the compiler, and the method and level of subroutines implementation and the computer.<<ETX>>
