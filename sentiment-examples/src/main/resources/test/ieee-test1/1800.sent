The report is intended to aid the electric power industry in reporting and analyzing outrage occurrences of transmission facilities. Use of systematic, precise definitions is essential for meaningful exchange of data. It is expected that specific instructions for reporting outages will be developed by the industry based on these definitions. The outage definitions and indices are intended for use in system planning models operations and maintenance planning, and system design. The definitions and indices may not be sufficiently detailed to cover the information required for equipment design.<<ETX>>
