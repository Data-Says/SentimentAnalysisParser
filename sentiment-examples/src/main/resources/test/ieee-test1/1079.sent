The detection of certain gases generated in an oil-filled transformer in service is frequently the first available indication of a possible malfunction that may eventually lead to failure if not corrected. In a transformer, generated gases are found dissolved in the insulating oil. They may also be found in the gas blanket above the oil or in gas-collecting devices. The purpose of this guide is to describe the details and procedure for the gas analysis of gas from gas spaces or gas-collecting devices and for gas dissolved in the oil. It covers the instruments used for gas detection, procedures for obtaining gas samples and analysis methods. Interpretation of the results is also included.<<ETX>>
