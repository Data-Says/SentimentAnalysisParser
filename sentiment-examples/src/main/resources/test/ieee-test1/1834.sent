A test procedure for the impulse testing of insulated conductors (cables) and cables with accessories installed (cable systems) is provided in this standard. This procedure can be used as a design or qualification test for cables or for cable systems. This test procedure is not intended to replace any existing or future standards covering cable or cable accessories, impulse generators, impulse testing, or voltage measurements. It is intended to supplement such standards by providing specific procedures for impulse testing on specific type of cables, accessories, or cable systems.
