Test requirements for conducting conformance tests on instrument transformers used on 60 Hz primary systems with voltages from 600 V through 38 kV are covered. This standard also covers selection of transformers for conformance testing, basis for conformance, treatment of failures, tests required, (e.g., impulse, voltage withstand, accuracy, temperature rise, mechanical rating), insulation system acceptance, and production monitoring.
