The purpose is to define and recommend specifications that deal with mechanical and electrical design, electrical insulation systems, corrosion protection, and electrical and mechanical testing for severe duty squirrel-cage polyphase induction motors for chemical industry application. Many of the recommended materials and components in this recommended practice stem from experience with severely corrosive atmospheres and the necessity for safe, quiet, reliable, energy-efficient motors. These recommendations apply to totally enclosed fan-cooled (TEFC), horizontal and vertical, single speed, squirrel-cage polyphase induction motors, NEMA frame size 143T through 449T (TS).<<ETX>>
