This recommended practice defines many common parameters for AC-DC and DC-DC electronic power distribution components and subsystems. This enables electronic system engineers, manufacturers, and researchers to speak with a common language and hence facilitates effective and efficient communications. Furthermore, implementation of a common specification language will allow the power electronics industry as well as the user communities, including government system developers, to acquire cost- and time-effective electronic power subsystems with significantly enhanced interchangeability.
