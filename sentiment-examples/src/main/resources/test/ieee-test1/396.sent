This standard is intended to aid the electric power industry in reporting and evaluating electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity. This standard was developed to overcome present difficulties in the interpretation of electric generating unit performance data from various systems and to facilitate comparisons among different systems. It should also make possible the future exchange of meaningful data among systems in the United States, Canada, and throughout the world.
