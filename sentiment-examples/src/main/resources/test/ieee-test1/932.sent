On-site acceptance tests of ultra-high-voltage power equipment are subject to thisguide. Criteria and requirements for test items, conditions, methods, and results are established.The stated specifications and requirements, both technical and for testing, are universally neededfor acceptance tests on-site and commissioning of ultra-high-voltage power equipment, includingpower transformers, reactors, capacitive voltage transformers, bushing-type current transformers,gas-insulated switchgear, air insulated grounding switches, air insulated disconnecting switches,bushings, metal-oxide surge arresters, suspension insulators, post insulators, and insulating oil,etc. It will be sufficient for most installations.
