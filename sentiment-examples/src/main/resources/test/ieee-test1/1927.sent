This document specifies an exchange format, using the extensible Markup Language (XML), for exchanging the test description information defining test performance, test conditions, diagnostic requirements, and support equipment to locate, align, and verify the proper operation of a Unit Under Test (UUT). This is in support of the development of Test Program Sets (TPSs) that will be used in an automatic test environment.
