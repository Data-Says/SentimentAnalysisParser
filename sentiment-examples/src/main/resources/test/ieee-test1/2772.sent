Insulation systems for direct-current machines are classified in accordance with their limiting temperatures as determined by test rather than by chemical composition. The intention is to classify according to the recognized A, B, F, and H categories by determining thermal capability in accordance with machine temperature-rise standards. This test procedure has been prepared to indicate accepted tests. It is applicable to insulation systems for use in usual service conditions. This standard does not cover special requirements such as for machines in gas atmospheres being subjected to strong chemicals, metal dusts, or submersion in liquids.
