The application of Damped ac (DAC) for field testing of power cables is described. DAC voltage withstand testing and diagnostic tests and measurements that are performed in combination with DAC voltage application in the field on shielded power cable systems are discussed. Whenever possible, cable systems are treated in a similar manner to individual cables. Tables and figures are included to show the effectiveness of the DAC ac voltage test, the diagnostic evaluation and the user experiences in the past years for field testing of different medium and (extra) high voltage cable system.
