Ethernet local area network operation is specified for selected speeds of operationfrom 1 Mb/s to 10 Gb/s using a common media access control (MAC) specification, managementinformation base (MIB), and capability for Link Aggregation of multiple physical links into a singlelogical link. The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocolspecifies shared medium (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation. Speed specificMedia Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected physical layer (PHY) interfaces foroperation over coxial, twisted pair or fiber optic cables. System considerations for multisegmentshared access networks describe the use of Repeaters which are defined for operational speedsup to 1000 Mb/s. Local Area Network (LAN) operation is supported at all speeds. Other specifiedcapabilities include: various PHY types for access networks, PHYs suitable for metropolitan areanetwork applications, and the provision of power over selected twisted pair PHY types.
