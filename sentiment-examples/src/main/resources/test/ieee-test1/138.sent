It is the purpose of this Recommended Practice to define acceptable methods of testing electrical insulation in flight electric equipment. Test procedures are recommended for inspection of equipment electrical insulation to determine its flight worthiness after service, repair, and/or periods of storage. This Recommended Practice is intended only as a guide to acceptable procedure. It is not intended to be used as a test specification for specific equipment. The values of test voltages and other test conditions for specific equipment are always determined by the procurement specification for that particular equipment.<<ETX>>
