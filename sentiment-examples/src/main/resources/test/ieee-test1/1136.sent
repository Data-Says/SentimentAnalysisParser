The basic engineering approach to the control of vibration of overhead conductors is to compare, at an acceptable amplitude, the wind power input with the power dissipated by the conductor and supporting structures and hardware. The difference between these two quantities is the amount of power that ideally should be dissipated by a vibration damping system, when attached to a single conductor at one or more appropriate locations. This guide describes the procedures for determining the performance of vibration damping systems. It is hoped that the guide will assist in standardizing the methods involved and that it will result in more reliable basic information on damper dissipation characteristics, on a basis that is consistent with the technical requirements, and that is universally recognized and accepted.<<ETX>>
