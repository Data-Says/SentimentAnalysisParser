This recommended practice provides recommendations for the design and coordinated deployment of fixed broadband wireless access systems in order to control interference and facilitate coexistence. It analyzes appropriate coexistence scenarios and provides guidance for system design, deployment, coordination, and frequency usage. It generally addresses licensed spectrum between 2 GHz and 66 GHz, with a detailed emphasis on 3.5 GHz, 10.5 GHz, and 23.5 43.5 GHz.
