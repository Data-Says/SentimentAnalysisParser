The purpose of this standard is to establish uniform procedures for the measurement of audible noise from overhead transmission lines, using instrumentation that conforms to ANSI S1.4-1983, ANSI S1.11-1966 (R 1976), ANSI/ASC S1.6-1984, ANSI/SAE J184a-1979 and IEC 651-1979. A uniform procedure is a prerequisite to valid evaluation and comparisons of the audible noise performance of various overhead power transmission lines. The standard covers manual and automatic audible noise measurements from overhead power transmission lines.<<ETX>>
