Standard test interface language (STIL) provides an interface between digital test generation tools and test equipment. A test description language is defined that: (a) facilitates the transfer of digital test vector data from CAE to ATE environments; (b) specifies pattern, format, and timing information sufficient to define the application of digital test vectors to a DUT; and (c) supports the volume of test vector data generated from structured tests.
