The standard provides specifications for applying 8-bit microprocessors to a low-cost modular busing scheme. The signals for this bus are generally derived directly from the processor device and are buffered but not retimed. This scheme results in some modules being processor-device dependent. The body of this standard provides a core specification for the device-independent parameters. Appendixes provide device-dependent parameters for various processors.<<ETX>>
