Required procedures for performing design tests for high-voltage distribution class and power class fuses, as well as for fuse disconnecting switches and enclosed single-pole air switches, are specified. These design tests, as appropriate to a particular device, include the following test types: dielectric, interrupting, load-break, radio-influence, short-time current, temperature-rise, time-current, manual-operation, thermal-cycle, bolt-torque, and liquid-tightness.
