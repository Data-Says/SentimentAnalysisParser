The object of this standard is to define the terms specifically related to the digital recorders used for monitoring high-voltage (HV) and high-current impulse tests, to specify the necessary performance characteristics for such digital recorders in order to ensure their compliance with the requirements for high-voltage and for high-current impulse tests, and to indicate the tests and procedures that are necessary to show that these performance characteristics are within those specified limits.<<ETX>>
