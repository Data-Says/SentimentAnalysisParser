Withdrawn Standard. Withdrawn Date: Feb 06, 2006. This standard describes a utility telemetry service architecture operated over the telephone network. The architecture described is a basic transport architecture capable of supporting many different applications. The text is described in terms of a utility meter reading application, but any enhanced service provider (ESP) communication can be transported. Telemetry calls may be initiated by either the utility/service provider (outbound) or the telemetry interface unit (TIU)/CPE (inbound) on the end user's premise.
