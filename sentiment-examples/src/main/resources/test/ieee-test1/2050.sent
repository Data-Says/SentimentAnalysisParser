Electrical ratings and test requirements of cable joints used with extruded and laminated dielectric shielded cable rated in preferred voltage steps from 2500 V to 500 000 V are established in this standard. In addition, test requirements for cable jacket and cable shield restoration devices are defined. A variety of common joint constructions are also defined. This standard has been designed to provide uniform testing procedures that can be used by manufacturers and users to evaluate the ability of underground power cable joints, and associated cable shield and cable jacket restoration components, to perform reliably in service.
