Surge protectors for application on multiconductor and coaxial, balanced orunbalanced, data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages less than or equal to1000 V rms or 1200 V dc are covered. These surge protectors are multiple-component series orparallel combinations of one or more nonlinear elements and zero or more linear elements. Thetables of typical performance values provide a means of comparison among various surgeprotectors. They also provide a common engineering language beneficial to the user andmanufacturer of surge protectors used in low-voltage data, communications, and signalingcircuits.
