The IEEE standard applies to a two terminal avalanche junction surge suppressor for surge protective application on systems with DC to 420 Hz frequency and voltages equal to or less than 1000 V rms or 1200 V DC. The avalanche junction surge suppressor is a semiconductor diode which can operate in either the forward or reverse direction of its V-I characteristic. The device is a single package which may be assembled from any combination of series and/or parallel diode chips. This standard contains definitions, service conditions, and a series of test criteria for determining the electrical characteristics of these semiconductor avalanche junction surge suppressors.<<ETX>>
