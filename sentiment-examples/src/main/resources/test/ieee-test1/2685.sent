Safe and reliable methods for the electrical protection of telecommunication facilities serving electric supply locations through the use of metallic wire-line components in part of the telecommunication circuit and optical fiber systems in the remainder of the telecommunication circuit are presented in this standard. Hybrid applications have an equipment junction between the metallic wire-line and the fiber cable, i.e., a wire-linefiber cable junction (CFJ).
