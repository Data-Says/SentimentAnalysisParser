The Criteria for Nuclear Power Generating Station Protection Systems, IEEE Std 279-1971, establish minimum requirements for the safety-related functional performance and reliability of the protection system for stationary, land-based nuclear reactors producing steam for electric power generation. These requirements include, but are not limited to,the capability for testing the protection system. In order to develop tests and establish test procedures, an expansion and interpretation of the test capabilities specified in IEEE Std 279-1971 is necessary.
