A complete nuclear power generating station security program consists of security personnel, barriers, security and contingency plans, procedures, and security equipment. The purpose of this standard is to establish criteria to guide the designer in the selection and application of equipment to detect, monitor, display, and record security conditions at nuclear power generating stations. These criteria include minimum design, testing, and maintenance parameters for permanently or temporarily installed systems, subsystems, or components used by the security force for monitoring, surveillance, access control, communication, and data acquisition.<<ETX>>
