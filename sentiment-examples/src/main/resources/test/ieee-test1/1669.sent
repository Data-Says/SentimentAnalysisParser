Guidelines for uniform measurement and reporting of sound produced by AC power circuit breakers are established. The methods are intended for measuring the sound produced by outdoor circuit breakers in a free-field environment. The methods may be used indoors or in a restricted field, provided that precautions are observed in measurement and interpretation of results. Three types of tests are described: design tests, conformance tests, and field tests. The methods are intended to provide data that can be used in evaluating the effects of circuit breaker sound on human observers, but the evaluation itself is not covered.
