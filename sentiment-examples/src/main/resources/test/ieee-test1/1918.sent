Two audio program level measuring devices, the peak-program meter and the standard volume indicator, are described. The peak-program meter is intended to indicate the peak level of audio signals that the transmission or recording medium must accommodate if audible distortion is to be avoided. The standard volume indicator is intended to provide a means to assign numerical values to the average magnitude of audio program signals. The dynamic response requirements specified in this standard for the peak-program meter are identical to the normal mode European Broadcasting Union standard peak-program meter. This standard does, however, allow more flexibility for the selection of the scale.<<ETX>>
