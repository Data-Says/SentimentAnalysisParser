This guide recommends tests and evaluation procedures, as well as criteria and methods of maintenance for less flammable hydrocarbon (LFH) transformer insulating fluids. These are also known as high molecular weight hydrocarbon (HMWH) fluids. HMWH dielectric fluids are defined as those fluids having an ASTM D92 fire point of 300 degrees C or greater, being primarily composed of, but not restricted to, hydrocarbons. These fluids meet the requirements of ANSI/NFPA 70-1990, National Electrical Code, Article 450-23 as a less flammable dielectric for use in indoor applications when used in properly designed and installed transformers. Methods of reconditioning LFH fluids are also described.<<ETX>>
