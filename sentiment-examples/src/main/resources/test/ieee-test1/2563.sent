This standard applies to surge-protective devices designed for repeated limiting of voltage surges on 50 Hz or 60 Hz power circuits by passing surge discharge current and subsequently automatically interrupting the flow of follow current. This standard applies to devices for separate mounting and to those supplied integrally with other equipment.
