This standard provides standard test procedures for amplifiers and preamplifiers for semiconductordetectors for ionizing radiation. It supersedes the previous edition, IEEE Std 301-1969(ANSI N42.2-1969). The standard has been modified and refined based on the experience gained inusing the earlier edition over a six-year period and taking into account advances in the technology.Improvements in preamplifier noise characteristics and pulse shaping techniques as well as increasedutilization of integral detector-preamplifier assemblies have occurred in recent years.
