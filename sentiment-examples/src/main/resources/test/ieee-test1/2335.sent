IEEE Std 187-2003 is the standard for measurement methods of emissions from FM and television broadcast receivers in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 40 GHz. Spurious radiation from sound and television broadcast receivers of the superheterodyne type are possible sources of interference with other radio services. This standard describes the potential sources of spurious radiation from receivers intended for the reception of sound and television broadcasts, and the measurement methods for them.
