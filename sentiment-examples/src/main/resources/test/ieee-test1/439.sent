In this Standard are set forth methods for the measurement of test voltages and wave shapes used in dielectric tests of electric apparatus or insulating material. These tests are in three classes: 1. Puncture tests. 2. Flashover tests.3. Voltage proof tests. The tests may involve the use of alternating current, direct current, or surges from surge generators. Different pieces of apparatus may require different dielectric tests, some requiring power frequency or direct current tests only; other apparatus may require surge tests in addition. The specific requirements for any particular type of apparatus will be found in the Standard dealing with that type of apparatus. This Standard deals with the measurements themselves.
