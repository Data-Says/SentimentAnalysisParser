This document contains two standards. ANSI N42.5 specifies bases for Geiger-Mueller counter tubes. ANSI N42.6 specifies interrelating mechanical and electrical properties so that quartz-fiber exposure meters may be used with any charger. Characteristics peculiar to these devices but not affecting the interrelationship between chargers and exposure meters are omitted.
