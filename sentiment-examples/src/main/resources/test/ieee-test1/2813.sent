Reference models for tool-to-organization interconnections, tool-to-platform interconnections, and information transfer among tools are provided. The purpose is to establish agreements for information transfer among tools in the contexts of human organization, a computer system platform, and a software development application. To make the transfer of semantic information among tools easier, a semantic transfer language (STL) is also provided. Interconnections that must be considered when buying, building, testing, or using computing system tools for specifying behavioral descriptions or requirements of system and software products are described.
