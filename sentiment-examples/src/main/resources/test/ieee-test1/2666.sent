A digital interface for connecting multiple physically separated transducers to a single processor over a single pair of wires. The interface can support both asynchronous and isochronous data transfers. Several Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS) and their data formats are described. An electrical interface, channel identification protocols, time synchronization protocols, read and write logic functions to access the TEDS, and transducers with a wide variety of attributes are defined. This standard does not specify signal conditioning, signal conversion, or how an application uses the TEDS data.
