This guide covers the application of indoor and outdoor high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V for use in commercial, industrial, and utility installations. It deals with usage under varied service conditions, temperature conditions affecting continuous current compensation, reduced dielectrics, reclosng derating as applicable, calculation of system short-circuit current, compensation at different X/R ratios, detailed calculations with application curves, out-of-phase switching, and general application.
