Test equipment requirements and methods for testing the transmission characteristics of PCM telecommunications equipment, circuits, and systems are set forth. The requirements are intended for certification, installation, pre-service, out-of-service operational, and in-service operational tests of the PCM transmission facilities. The PCM equipment that may be tested includes primary multiplex equipment containing analog-digital conversion devices, digital multiplex equipment, digital links, and digital sections. This standard is limited to testing at the analog interfaces of the primary multiplex equipment and the digital interfaces at DS1, DS1C, DS2, and DS3 levels of the North American digital hierarchy. Synchronous multiplex equipment and equipment offering other than 64 kb/s coded voiceband channels are not covered in this standard, nor is signaling parameter measurement.<<ETX>>
