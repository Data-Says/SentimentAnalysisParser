This IEEE standard provides uniform and acceptable terms for use in the application of solar cells to power systems. The terms are useful in unifying expressions used in engineering writing and in the preparation of specifications and procurement documents. It is expected that this standard will be most useful to persons not expert in the solar cell field.<<ETX>>
