A physical (PHY) layer enabling the use of the 865 MHz to 867 MHz band in India is defined in this amendment. The supported data rate should be at least 40 kb/s and the typical line-of-sight range should be on the order of 5 km using an omnidirectional antenna. Included are any channel access and/or timing changes in the medium access control necessary to support this PHY layer.
