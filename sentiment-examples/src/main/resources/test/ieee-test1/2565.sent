A method for real-time exchange of synchronized phasor measurement data between power system equipment is defined. This standard specifies messaging that can be used with any suitable communication protocol for real-time communication between phasor measurement units (PMU), phasor data concentrators (PDC), and other applications. It defines message types, contents, and use. Data types and formats are specified. A typical measurement system is described. Communication options and requirements are described in annexes. Keywords: data concentrator, DC, IEEE C37.118.2, PDC, phasor, phasor data concentrator, phasor measurement unit, PMU, synchronized phasor, synchrophasor.
