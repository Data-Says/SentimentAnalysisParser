The purpose of this standard is to establish a common language for describing functional tests of memory devices. That language definition includes the vocabulary and grammar necessary to specify the functional testing of memory devices. The language is intended to be used as a general descriptive language rather than one for programming a tester. As a result, the grammar and syntax are defined in a looser and more general way than would be required for a programming language.
