This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2008 extends Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) operation to 10 Gb/s providing both symmetric, 10 Gb/s downstream and upstream, and asymmetric, 10 Gb/s downstream and 1 Gb/s upstream, data rates. It specifies the 10 Gb/s EPON Reconciliation Sublayer, 10GBASE-PR symmetric and 10/1GBASE-PRX Physical Coding Sublayers (PCSs) and Physical Media Attachments (PMAs), and Physical Medium Dependent sublayers (PMDs) that support both symmetric and asymmetric data rates while maintaining complete backward compatibility with already deployed 1 Gb/s EPON equipment. The EPON operation is defined for distances of at least 10 km and at least 20 km, and for split ratios of 1:16 and 1:32. An additional MAC control opcode is also defined to provide organization specific extension operation.
