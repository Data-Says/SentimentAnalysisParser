This guide addresses the application, design concepts, and implementation of computer-based control systems for hydroelectric plant automation. It addresses functional capabilities, performance requirements, interface requirements, hardware considerations, and operator training. It includes recommendations for system testing and acceptance. The electrical protective system (generator and step-up transformer) is beyond the scope of this guide.
