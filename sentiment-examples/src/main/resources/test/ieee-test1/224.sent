A method of collecting and presenting reliability data for use in nuclear power generating station reliability calculations is established. It applies to reliability data for electrical, electronic, sensing component, and mechanical equipment. The objectives of the calculations are: (1) to determine system adequacy; (2) to evaluate system design alternatives; (3) to evaluate, or contribute to, the development of system test intervals, maintenance programs, or operating procedures, or all three; and (4) to contribute to probabilistic risk-assessment studies.
