The intent of this standard is to establish a uniform method by which the life of specialty transformer insulation systems can be compared. Thermal degradation is generally one of the major factors affecting the life of most insulating materials. It was chosen to be the major environmental factor in this standard. Other environmental factors, such as vibration, thermal shock, and moisture, have been included to simulate operating conditions. These factors have been chosen in such a way as to develop and disclose promptly any significant weaknesses during the temperature aging of an insulation system. This standard is offered as a guide for preparing samples, conducting tests, and analyzing results. It provides a statistical method for establishing a life-temperature relationship of an insulation system and is intended to be an evaluation test, and not a production inspection or acceptance test.<<ETX>>
