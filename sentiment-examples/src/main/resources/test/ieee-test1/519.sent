This test code has been prepared in the hope that it will serve as a useful guide for the evaluation of insulation systems for random wound rotating electric machines, and to establish a sound basis for their temperature classification. Once this is accomplished in orderly and organized fashion, the problems of insulation selection for use in electric apparatus should be simplified. The code defines test procedures. It does not establish any normal values for insulation life, nor does it provide any standards of performance whatever.
