This standard establishes ratings and requirements for planning, design, testing, installation and operation of gas-insulated substations for alternating current applications. Typical installations are assemblies of specialized devices such as circuit breakers, switches, bushings, bus, and instrumentation. The standard is split into four sections: an introduction giving references and definitions; standards for various pieces of equipment in substations; recommended practices for handling SF/sub 6/ gas; and a guide to testing requirements.<<ETX>>
