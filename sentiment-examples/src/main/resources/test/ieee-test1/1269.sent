The IEEE Recommended Practice for Installation and Maintenance of Nickel-Cadmium Batteries for Photovoltaic (PV) Systems, provides safety precautions, installation design considerations, and procedures for receiving, storing, commissioning, and maintaining pocket and fiber-plate nickel-cadmium storage batteries for photovoltaic power systems. Disposal and recycling recommendations are also discussed. This recommended practice applies to all terrestrial photovoltaic power systems, regardless of size or application, that contain nickel-cadmium battery storage subsystems.<<ETX>>
