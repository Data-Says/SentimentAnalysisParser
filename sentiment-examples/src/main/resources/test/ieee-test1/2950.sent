A specification format guide for the preparation of a rate-integrating gyroscope specification is presented. Recommended procedures for testing a rate-integrating gyroscope are compiled. This standard, when combined with IEEE Std 517-1974 (R1980), defines the requirements and test procedures in terms of characteristics unique to the gyroscope or those applications in which the dynamic angular inputs are significantly greater than the limitations identified in IEEE Std 517. (An errata is available for this standard at http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/errata/529-1980.pdf)
