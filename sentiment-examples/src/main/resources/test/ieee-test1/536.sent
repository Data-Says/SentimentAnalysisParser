This standard applies to all single or multi-pole alternating-current automatic circuit reclosers and automatic line sectionalizers for the nominal voltages from 1,500 to 23,000 volts. In order to simplify this standard where possible: The term "recloser" has been substituted for "automatic circuit recloser." The term "sectionalizer" has been substituted for "automatic line sectionalizer".
