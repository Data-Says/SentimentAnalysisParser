In this IEEE standard general recommendations for fall protection and worker protection are provided. Sufficient details of the methods, equipment, and training requirements necessary to provide safe and adequate procedures for personnel working at elevated worksites are presented. The selected comprehensive recommendations are based on sound engineering principles, engineering safety considerations, and research into the tools, methods, practices, and training provided to and by electric power and communications workers. This guide applies to electric distribution, transmission, and generation work, communications work (including CATV), line clearance tree trimming work (tree work performed from an aerial lift device or from a ladder), and structure painting.
