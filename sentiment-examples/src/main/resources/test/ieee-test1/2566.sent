Modifications in this amendment include some performance requirements with related text updates to correct inconsistencies and remove limitations introduced by IEEE Std C37.118.1(TM)-2011. It was discovered that a few requirements were not achievable with the published models as was intended and others were extremely difficult to meet with available hardware. This amendment modifies requirements in Table 4 through Table 10. Text was modified to support the requirement modification. Testing described in 5.5.9 was clarified, and Table 11 (formerly Table 12) was modified to match. Annex C was modified to keep it consistent with the rest of the document.
