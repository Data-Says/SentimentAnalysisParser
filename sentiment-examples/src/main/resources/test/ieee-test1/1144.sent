The application of design methods and design documentation recommended in IEEE Std 1016-1987 is described. Several common design methods are used to illustrate the application of IEEE Std 1016-1987, thus making the concepts of that standard more concrete. The information in the guide may be applied to commercial, scientific, or military software that runs on any computer. Applicability is not restricted by the size, complexity, or criticality of the software.<<ETX>>
