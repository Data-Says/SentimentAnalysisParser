This specification defines the requirements and test procedures for a digital accelerometer which utilizes a linear, single-axis, nongyroscopic acceleration sensor with a permanent magnet torquer (forcer) operated in a ternary pulse mode, pulse-width modulation mode, or analog mode with voltage to frequency converter. The electronics are considered to be part of the accelerometer which produces a digital output proportional to sensed velocity changes. With appropriate modifications, this specification may also be applied to force balance nonpendulous accelerometers.<<ETX>>
