An electric penetration assembly is an assembly of insulated electric conductors,conductor seals, module seals (if any), and aperture seals that provides the passage of theelectric conductors through a single aperture in the nuclear containment structure, while providinga pressure barrier between the inside and the outside of the containment structure. The electricpenetration assembly includes terminal (junction) boxes, terminal blocks, connectors and cablesupports, and splices which are designed and furnished as an integral part of the assembly.Requirements for the design, construction, qualification, test, and installation of electricpenetration assemblies in nuclear containment structures for stationary nuclear power generatingstations are prescribed in this standard.
