ANSI N42.17C-1989 describes the minimum acceptable performance criteria for health physics instrumentation for use under extreme environmental conditions for monitoring ionizing radiation fields. This standard supplements the basic performance specifications for portable health physics instrumentation presented in ANSI N42.17A-1989. Included in ANSI N42.17C are testing methods to be used to establish the acceptability of each type of instrumentation.<<ETX>>
