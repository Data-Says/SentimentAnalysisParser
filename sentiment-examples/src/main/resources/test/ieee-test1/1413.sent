IEEE Std C95.3-1991 specifies techniques and instrumentation for the measurement of potentially hazardous electromagnetic fields. The recommendations apply to hazards to personnel. However, the measurement techniques and instruments described are also applicable to the measurement of fields in the neighborhood of flammable materials and explosive devices, even though exposure standards for these situations have not been established.<<ETX>>
