This recommended practice is limited to providing recommended practices of maintenance, test schedules, and testing procedures than can be used to optimize the life and performance of large lead storage batteries. It also provides guidance to determine when batteries should be replaced. There are other test procedures and replacement techniques used within the industry (especially for smaller substation batteries) which are equally as effective but are beyond the scope of this recommended practice.<<ETX>>
