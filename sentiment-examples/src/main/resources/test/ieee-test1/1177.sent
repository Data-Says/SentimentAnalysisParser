This Test Procedure has been prepared in the hope that it will serve as a useful guide for the evaluation of insulation systems for form-wound coils for alternating-current stators and to establish a sound basis for their temperature classification. Once this is accomplished in orderly and organized fashion, the problems of insulation selection for use in electric apparatus should be simplified. The purpose is to define procedures, and not to establish any normal values for insulation life, nor to provide any standards of performance whatever.
