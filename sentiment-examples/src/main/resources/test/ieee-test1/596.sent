This standard specifies the operational and performance requirements for transportable and/or mobile radiation monitors used in U.S. Homeland Security applications. Transportable radiation monitors are designed to be transported to a location and used for a specific task or for a specified period of time and do not require permanent mounting platforms. Mobile monitors are those systems that are typically in operation on a platform that is in motion. This standard also addresses radiation detection systems that can be carried on a person such as backpack-type systems.
