This recommended practice establishes requirements for a three-conductor round-type oil well cable used in supplying three-phase ac electric power to submersible pump motors. Cables meeting the requirements of the recommended practice should be rated for voltages not exceeding 3 kV and for ambient temperatures not exceeding 167 F (75 C). Use of cable above rated temperature can cause premature deterioration of the insulation. The cable defined herein is not recommended for installation below a temperature of 14 F (-10 C). Voltage ratings are nominal phase-to-phase ratings.
