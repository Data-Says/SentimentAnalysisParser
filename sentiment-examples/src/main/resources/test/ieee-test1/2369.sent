The standard applies to metal-oxide surge arresters designed to repeatedly limit the voltage surges on 48 Hz to 62 Hz AC power circuits by passing surge discharge current and automatically limiting the flow of system power current. The standard presents minimum criteria for the testing of the surge arresters and also incorporates an aging procedure to simulate the long-term effects of voltage and temperature.<<ETX>>
