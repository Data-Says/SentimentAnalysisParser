The standard describes the minimum acceptable performance criteria for instrumentation used to monitor occupational exposure to airborne radioactive materials. Included in the standard are testing methods to establish the acceptability of each air monitor. Tests involve air sampling capability; power, electronic, and alarm capabilities; radiation and interfering responses; and environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and ambient pressure.<<ETX>>
