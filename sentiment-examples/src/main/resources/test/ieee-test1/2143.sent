This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2005 includes the new Clause 69 through Clause 74. Clause 69 provides an overview of Ethernet operation over electrical backplanes. Clause 70 through Clause 72 define three new PMDs developed for operation over electrical backplanes. 1000 BASE-KX specifies 1 Gb/s serial operation, 10 GBASE-KX4 specifies 10 Gb/s 4-lane operation, and 10 GBASE-KR specifies 10 Gb/s serial operation. Clause 73 specifies an Auto-Negotiation function for use over electrical backplanes. Finally, Clause 74 specifies an optional forward error correction (FEC) sublayer for 10 GBASE-R PHYs for improved link performance.
