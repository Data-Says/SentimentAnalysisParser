This standard establishes methods for testing and measuring the performance characteristics for surge-protective devices used in low-voltage AC power circuits. Definitions are stated that apply specifically to surge-protective devices. The testing requirements are categorized into two groups, in which a minimum set of basic tests (BTs) are prescribed for all surge-protective devices within the scope of its documents, supplemented by additional tests (ATs) that might be needed to establish particular application requirements.
