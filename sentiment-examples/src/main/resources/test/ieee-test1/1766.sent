Specification and test requirements for a single-axis interferometric fiber optic gyro (IFOG)for use as a sensor in attitude control systems, angular displacement measuring systems, and angular rate measuring systems are defined. A standard specification format guide for the preparation of a single-axis IFOG is provided. A compilation of recommended procedures for testing a fiber optic gyro, derived from those presently used in the industry, is also provided.
