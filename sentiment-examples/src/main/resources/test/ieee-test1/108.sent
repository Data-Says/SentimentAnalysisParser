The intent of this guide is to provide guidance to management and engineers to develop an integrated program for the application of human factors engineering (HFE) in the design, operation, and maintenance of nuclear power generating stations. This guide is intended to provide overall guidance for establishing a program for the application of HFE to systems, equipment, and facilities of nuclear power generating stations. It is applicable to new facilities or modifications to existing facilities. Guidance is provided on the program organization and applicability, the plant design aspects to consider, the HFE methodologies that may be used, and a typical program plan for the application of HFE.<<ETX>>
