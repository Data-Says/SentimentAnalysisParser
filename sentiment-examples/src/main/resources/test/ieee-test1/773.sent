The subset of the Project Management Body of Knowledge that is generally accepted is identified and described in this guide. Generally accepted means that the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time, and that there is widespread consensus about their value and usefulness. It does not mean that the knowledge and practices should be applied uniformly to all projects without considering whether they are appropriate.
