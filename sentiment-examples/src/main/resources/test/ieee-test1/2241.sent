This document amends IEEE Std 802.16-2001 by enhancing the medium access control layer and providing additional physical layer specifications in support of broadband wireless access at frequencies from 2-11 GHz. The resulting standard specifies the air interface of fixed (stationary) broadband wireless access systems providing multiple services. The medium access control layer is capable of supporting multiple physical layer specifications optimized for the frequency bands of application. The standard includes particular physical layer specifications applicable to systems operating between 2 and 66 GHz. It supports point-to-multipoint and optional mesh topologies.
