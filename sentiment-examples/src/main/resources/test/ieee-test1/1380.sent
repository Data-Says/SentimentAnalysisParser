The recommended practice provides component function identifiers that, when used with related recommended practices concerning unique identification principles and definitions, implementation instructions, and system descriptions, provides a basis for uniquely identifying systems, structures, and components of nuclear and fossil-fueled power plant projects (electric power generating stations) and related facilities. This recommended practice is a part of a series of recommended practices, entitled the Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS), the purpose of which is to present a common language of communication that will permit a user to correlate a system, structure, or component with that of another organization for the purposes of reporting, comparison, or general communication. A significant feature of this concept is that the unique identification code identifies the function at the component level but does not identify the hardware itself.<<ETX>>
