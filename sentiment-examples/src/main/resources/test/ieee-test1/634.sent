This standard set forth, at least for reference purposes, a suggested set of EMC limits which may find general applications. As part of the development of limits, the following parameters should be considered: an understanding of the devices commonly used for the measurement of radio noise and their properties; the general properties of man-made and environmental noise; and the rationale that can be used in selecting a consistent set of limits for emission and immunity, subject to various environmental constraints. The selection of measurement parameters, instrumentation, measurement methods, environmental radio noise and limit setting are discussed. The measurement of amplitude distribution, envelope amplitude distribution, and amplitude probability distribution are also discussed.<<ETX>>
