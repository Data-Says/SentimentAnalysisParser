The VITAL (VHDL Initiative Towards ASIC Libraries) ASIC Modeling Specication is defined in this standard. This modeling specication defines a methodology which promotes the development of highly accurate, efficient simulation models for ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) components in VHDL.
