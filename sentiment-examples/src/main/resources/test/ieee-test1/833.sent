Substation rigid-bus structures reduce substation heights, have greater ampacity and lower corona than single conductor strain bus structures. The guide presents an integrated design approach for calculating the forces to which rigid bus structures are subjected. Design criteria for conductor and insulator strength calculations are also included.<<ETX>>
