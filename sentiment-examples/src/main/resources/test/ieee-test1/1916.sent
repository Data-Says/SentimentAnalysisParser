Data interchange and standard software services for test and diagnostic environments are defined by Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to All Test Environments (Al-ESTATE). The purpose of AI-ESTATE is to standardize interfaces for functional elements of an intelligent diagnostic reasoner and representations of diagnostic knowledge and data for use by such diagnostic reasoners. Formal information models are defined to form the basis for a format to facilitate exchange of persistent diagnostic information between two reasoners and also to provide a formal typing system for diagnostic services. The services to control a diagnostic reasoned are defined by this standard.
