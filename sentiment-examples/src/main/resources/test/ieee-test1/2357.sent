Metal-enclosed (ME) bus assemblies for indoor and outdoor use are covered in this standard.The types of assemblies covered are nonsegregated-phase bus, segregated-phase bus, andisolated-phase bus. Rated maximum voltages of ac ME bus assemblies range from 0.635 kVthrough 38 kV with continuous current ratings of 600 A through 26 000 A for self-cooled ratings andup to 40 000 A and above for force-cooled ratings. Rated maximum voltage levels of dc bus assembliesrange from 300 V through 3200 V with continuous current ratings of 600 A through 12 000 A.Service conditions, ratings, temperature limitations and classification of insulating materials, insulation (dielectric) withstand voltage requirements, test procedures, and application are discussed.A guide for calculating losses in isolated-phase bus is included.
