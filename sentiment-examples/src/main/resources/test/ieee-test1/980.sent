Design guidelines for cables with aluminum sheaths on low-, medium-, and high-voltage cables are provided. The aluminum sheath is an impervious aluminum or aluminum alloy tube applied either smooth or corrugated over the cable core. The sheath provides mechanical or electrical protection to the cable core and may or may not have an overall jacket or plastic over-sheath. The guide provides information on the application, selection, installation, and use parameters of aluminum sheaths. References and a bibliography related to the use of aluminum sheaths are included. Keywords: aluminum sheath, high-voltage power cable, low-voltage power cable, medium-voltage.
