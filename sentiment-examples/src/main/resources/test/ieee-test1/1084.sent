General guidelines toward the preparations of a functional specification of transmission fixed-series capacitor (FSC) banks using overvoltage protection based on three technologies are provided. The three technologies are:- metal oxide varistors-metal oxide varistors with a forced-triggered bypass gaps, and thyristor protected series capacitors- thyristor protected series capacitor. This guide does not apply comprehensively to thyristor-controlled series capacitors.
