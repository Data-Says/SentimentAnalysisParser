This standard lists technical terms and their definitions that have been adopted by, or coined for, the television broadcasting industry. It is mainly a combination of two earlier standards: IEEE Std201-1955, Definitions of Color Terms, and IEEE Std 204-1961, Definitions of Terms Relating to Television. Both were originally prepared by the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) prior to the merger of the IRE and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1963.
