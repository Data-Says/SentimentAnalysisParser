This Standard specifies a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Extensible Markup Language (XML) binding of the data model defined in IEEE Std 1484.11.1-2004. The purpose of this Standard is to allow for the creation of IEEE Standard 1484.11.1-2004 data-model instances in XML. This Standard uses the W3C XML Schema definition language as the encoding, which allows for interoperability and the exchange of data-model instances between various systems.
