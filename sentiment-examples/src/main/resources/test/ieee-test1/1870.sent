Air gaps for overvoltage protection applications on systems with operating voltages equal to or less than 600 V rms are covered. These protective devices are designed for limiting the voltages on balanced or unbalanced communication, power, and signaling circuits. A series of standard design tests for determining the electrical characteristics of these air gap devices is specified. The tests provide a means of comparison among various air gap surge-protective devices.
