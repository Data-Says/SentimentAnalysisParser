A method is described for obtaining synchronous machine parameters in the form of reactances and time constants. A new approach has demonstrated that stability parameters for synchronous machines can be obtained by performing frequency response tests with the machine at a standstill. Advantages of this method are that it can be done either in the factory or on site, it poses a low probability of risk to the machine being tested, and it provides complete data in both direct and quadrature axes.<<ETX>>
