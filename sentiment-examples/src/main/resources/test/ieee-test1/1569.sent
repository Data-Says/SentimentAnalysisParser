This Standard contains many of the terms one might encounter in exposition on the design and use of communication switching systems. Definitions of these terms have either been submitted for the first edition or prepared for subsequent editions of the forthcoming IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms. Certain terms and definitions have been drawn from American National Standard Definitions of Electrical Terms, ANS 042.65-1907, and other existing documents; the remainder are modified or new (those that are modified with respect to the first edition of the IEEE Dictionary are marked with an asterisk).
