This standard defines services and protocol elements that permit the downloading of memory images to data processing equipment attached to IEEE 802 local and metropolitan area networks. The protocol makes use of the group addressing capabilities inherent in LAN/MAN technologies to permit simultaneous loading of the same memory image to multiple destination systems. The standard includes the specification of managed objects that permit the operation of the load protocol to be remotely managed.<<ETX>>
