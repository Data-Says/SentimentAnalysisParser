Data messages, known as protocol data units (PDUs), that are exchanged on a network between simulation applications are defined. These PDUs are for interactions that take place withinspecified domains called protocol families, which include Entity Information/Interaction, Warfare,Logistics, Simulation Management, Distributed Emission Regeneration, Radio Communications,Entity Management, Minefield, Synthetic Environment, Simulation Management with Reliability,Live Entity Information/Interaction, and Non-Real Time.
