Methods used to place cable underground vary widely. The choice of method depends on such factors as soil conditions, surface and subsurface obstructions, total footage to be installed, spacing between taps or splices, joint trenching practices between utilities, depth of burial desired or required, size of cable, and tools available. This guide explores the interrelations of these contributing factors suggesting what should be considered, determinations to be made, and the decisions required before selecting the plowing method for the installation of direct buried cable.
