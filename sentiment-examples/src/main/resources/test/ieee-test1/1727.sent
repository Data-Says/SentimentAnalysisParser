Directions and requirements for the conversion of power switchgear equipment from the original manufacturers' designs, whether the conversion is performed in manufacturing plants or at installation sites, are provided. Low-voltage power circuit breakers, high-voltage outdoor and drawout indoor-type power circuit breakers, and metal-enclosed switchgear are covered. Existing design standards are fully referenced with appropriate guidance on what type of design testing is necessary to design-verify the conversions. Reconditioning, which concerns the maintenance of existing equipment without alteration, is not covered.<<ETX>>
