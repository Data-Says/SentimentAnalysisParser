The general information in this Guide is applicable to all forms of outdoor metal-enclosed switchgear. Specific data are given for outdoor metal-clad switchgear. The many combinations of sizes and ratings in similar housings make it impracticable to provide equivalent information for outdoor low-voltage metal-enclosed air circuit-breaker switchgear. Data are not yet available for specific recommendations for other switchgear equipment or components.
