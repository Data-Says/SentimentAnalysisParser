This document for ice tests is coordinated with the IEC Supplement to Publication 129 (1975), Alternating Current Disconnectors (Isolators) and Earthing Switches, entitled Additional Tests for Disconnectors and Earthing Switches, which are intended for severe conditions of ice formation. The C37.34 ice tests describe a method for natural environment (outdoor) testing that is not described in the IEC document. Paragraphs are rearranged to establish criteria fn- acceptance, which are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the standard. Specific requirements have been added for manually operated, poweroperated, and fault-initiating switches.
