Varistors for surge-protective applications on systems with dc to 420 Hz frequency and voltages equal to or less than 1000 V rms, or 1200 V dc, are covered. Definitions, service conditions, and a series of test criteria for determining the electrical characteristics of the varistors are provided. The tests are intended as design tests and provide a means of comparing various surge-protective devices.
