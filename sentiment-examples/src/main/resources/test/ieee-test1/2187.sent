This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3 defines the Time Synchronization Service Interface (TSSI) to indicate when the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) crosses the generic Medium Independent Interface (xMII), together with management objects indicating transmit and receive data delay between the Medium Dependent Interface (MDI) and xMII for the given Physical Layer devices (PHY). Both features are required to support time synchronization protocols, e.g., IEEE Std 802.1AS or IEEE Std 1588-2008.
