This standard applies to all overhead, pad mounted, dry vault and submersible single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers and fault interrupters for rated maximum voltages above 1000 V. In order to simplify this standard where possible, the term recloser has been substituted for automatic circuit recloser or fault interrupter or both.
