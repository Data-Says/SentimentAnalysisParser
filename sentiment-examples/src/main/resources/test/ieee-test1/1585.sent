Required procedures for performing design tests for high-voltage fuses, as well as for fuse disconnecting switches, are specified. These design tests, as appropriate to a particular device, include the following test types: dielectric, interrupting, radio-influence, temperature-rise, time-current, manual-operation, liquid-tightness, thermal-cycle, bolt-torque, withstand tests for motor circuit fuses, expulsion fuses using polymeric insulators, load-break, and short-time current.
