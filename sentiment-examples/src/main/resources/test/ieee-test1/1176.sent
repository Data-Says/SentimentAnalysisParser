This Test Procedure covers instructions for conducting and reporting the more generally applicable and acceptable tests to determine the performance characteristics of direct-current tachometer generators. Direct-current tachometer generators are used for a variety of indicating and control purposes and a characteristic of primary importance in one application may be of little or no importance in another. This Procedure shall not be interpreted or construed as requiring the making of all or any of the tests herein in any given transaction. It is recognized that there may be methods other than those described herein. When more than one method is available, local conditions and the degree of precision desired will determine the method to be used. It is also recognized that tests under or after exposure to unusual environmental conditions are important in some applications but the diversity of these requirements is such that it is not practical to include them at this time.
