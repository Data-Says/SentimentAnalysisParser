Minimum requirements for the structure and information content of user documentation are provided. They apply primarily to technical substance rather than to style. Editorial and stylistic considerations are addressed only when they impact structure and content. Only traditional documentation, either printed on paper or stored in some other medium in the format of a printed document and used in a manner analogous to the way a printed document is used, is addressed.
