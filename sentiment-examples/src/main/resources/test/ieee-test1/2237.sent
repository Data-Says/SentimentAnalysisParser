This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1 Q specifies the function of a MAC Relay with two MACs, and the protocols and procedures to support its operation. A MAC Relay is transparent to all frame-based media independent protocols except those explicitly addressed to this device. It is remotely manageable through at least one of its external MACs, and signals a failure of either MAC'S LAN through the other MAC.
