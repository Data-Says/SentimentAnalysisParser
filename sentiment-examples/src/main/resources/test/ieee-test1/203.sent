This standard applies to tests for high-voltage fuses (above 600 V), distribution enclosed single-pole air switches, fuse disconnecting switches, and accessories (for alternating-current distribution systems). It covers design tests, test practices, dielectric tests, interrupting tests, load-break tests, making current tests, radio-influence tests, temperature rise tests and time-current testing.<<ETX>>
