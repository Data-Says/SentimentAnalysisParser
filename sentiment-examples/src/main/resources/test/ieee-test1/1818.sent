Recommended methods and standardized reporting practices for electrical characterization of organic transistors are covered. Due to the nature of organic transistors, significant measurement errors can be introduced if not properly addressed. This standard describes the most common sources of measurement error, and gives recommended practices in order to minimize and/or characterize the effect of each.
