This standard, defines an architecture for the interconnection of IEEE 802 local area networks (LANs) below the level of the MAC Service, transparent to LLC and higher layer protocols. The operation and management of the connecting Bridges is specified. A spanning tree algorithm and protocol ensures a loop-free topology and provides redundancy. The bridging method is not particular to any MAC type-criteria for additional MAC-specific bridging methods are defined.<<ETX>>
