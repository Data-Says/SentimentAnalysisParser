This test procedure defines approved methods for conducting tests and reporting results to effect the uniform determination of rotating electric machine sound under steady-state conditions with an accuracy of +or-3 dB tested in three acoustical environments. These are: free field; reverberant field; and semireverberant field. This procedures assumes the presence of pure tones or the predominance of discrete frequencies in the sound spectrum.<<ETX>>
