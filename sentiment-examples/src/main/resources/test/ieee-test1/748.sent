This standard is a guide to aid in the selection and application of AC high-voltage circuit breakers on electrical power systems. Described in the guide are the general application conditions, application considerations, and short-circuit considerations necessary to apply alternating current circuit breakers. This standard is a revision of ANSI/IEEE C37.010-1972. This revision contains substantive revisions due to the efforts of a working group on revisions to C37.010-1972, and editorial changes as a result of general power circuit breaker consolidation efforts. Three substantive ns are included. The first involves deletion of a Procedure Chart, from Section 5.3, page 26, of the previous standard. The second substantive revision is an expansion of the statements in 5.3.2 involving the general terms "one transformation" and "two or more transformations" to recognize large external impedances such as long lines or station service transformers. The third substantive revision involves the rotating machine reactance table of multipliers on page 40.
