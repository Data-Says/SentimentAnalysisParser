The purpose of this Standard is to formalize existing standards for 5-level perforated tape used in communications; to include standards for 6-level, 7-level, and 8-level tape which will be compatible with these 5-level standards, in order to prevent confusion and minimize possible obsolescence of existing communications apparatus; and to serve as a basis for an American Standard covering perforated tape for communications use.
