This application guide for capacitance current switching applies to ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated in accordance with American National Standard Requirements for Capacitance Current Switching for AC HighVoltage Circuit Breakers, C37.073-1972. It is intended to supplement the American National Standard Application Guide for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers, C37.010-1972 (IEEE Std 320-1972), and specifically, to enlarge on Section 4.14.3, Capacitor Switching, and Section 4.14.4, Line Charging Switching. Circuit breakers rated and manufactured to meet other standards should be applied in accordance with application procedures adapted to their specific ratings.
