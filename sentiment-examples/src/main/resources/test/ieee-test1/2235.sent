Port-based network access control makes use of the physical access characteristics of IEEE 802/sup R/ local area networks (LAN) infrastructures in order to provide a means of authenticating and authorizing devices attached to a LAN port that has point-to-point connection characteristics, and of preventing access to that port in cases in which the authentication and authorization process fails.
