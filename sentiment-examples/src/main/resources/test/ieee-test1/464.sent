New definitions of terms associated with telemetering are proposed only when considered necessary and where no known suitable definition exists. No effort has been made to include all terms defined in existing formal glossaries, such as American Standard Definitions of Electrical Terms, ASA C42. It is realized that many terms defined in other publications apply to telemetering as well, and it is expected that these documents will assist in the standardization of telemetering nomenclature.
