The purpose of this standard is to establish functional requirements for measuring analog transmission characteristics of voice frequency telecommunication equipment including voiceband and wideband data transmission channels and program circuits, and to establish functional requirements for test equipment needed to make the required measurements. This standard will be useful for specifying test equipment for measuring the performance of subscriber loops, message network trunks, PBX trunks, tie lines, and other similar facilities.<<ETX>>
