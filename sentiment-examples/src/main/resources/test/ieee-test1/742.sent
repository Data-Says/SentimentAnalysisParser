Recommended methods and standardized reporting practices for electricalcharacterization of printed and organic ring oscillators are covered. Due to the nature of printedand organic circuits, significant measurement errors can be introduced if the electricalcharacterization design-of-experiment is not properly addressed. This standard describes themost common sources of measurement error, particularly for high-impedance electricalmeasurements commonly required for printed and organic ring oscillators. This standard alsogives recommended practices in order to minimize and/or characterize the effect of measurementartifacts and other sources of error encountered while measuring printed and organic ringoscillators.
