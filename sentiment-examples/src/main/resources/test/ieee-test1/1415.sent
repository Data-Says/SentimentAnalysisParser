The purpose of this recommended practice is to provide a general form for the preparation of test procedures and to suggest the points to be considered by technical committees in the preparation of specific instructions for the thermal evaluation of insulation systems for power equipment. These test procedures involve accelerated thermal aging of insulation systems and specify tests which the committees deem pertinent, based on conditions of use.
