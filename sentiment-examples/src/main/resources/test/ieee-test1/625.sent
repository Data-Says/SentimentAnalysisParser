This standard was developed as a replacement for Section 8. (Test Procedures) of American National Standard for Low-Voltage AC Power Circuit Protectors Used in Enclosures, C37.29-1974 (IEEE Std 508-1974), for the purpose of providing a separate document to facilitate use by independent testing laboratories. Since these test procedures are considered new by the laboratories, experience factors may require revision and a separate document can be revised quickly and economically.This standard is one of several in a series of test procedures standards for certification of various switchgear products. They establish the mandatory requirements that a product must meet (as certified by an independent testing laboratory) in order to satisfy federal law and local electrical codes.
