The electrical interfaces among the components comprising the auxiliary power systems and their electrical interface with other train-borne systems are described. As such, this standard treats the auxiliary power system components (e.g., static inverters and converters, low-voltage DC power supplies, back-up battery systems, and battery chargers) as black boxes and addresses only their interface requirements.
