This recommended practice covers definitions of terms, controlled test conditions, test apparatus, test methods and data presentation, all of which form the basis for establishing the energy levels of spurious emissions of mobile communication transmitters designed to generate frequency-modulated (FM) signals in the frequency range of 25 MHz to 1000 MHz. Procedures for measuring both broadband and narrowband spectra are provided for both conducted and radiated emissions. Specified limits are not included. However, reference values which are not limited by the state of the art are provided. Transmitter test conditions, apparatus and method are based on standard instrumentation and measuring techniques and do not require any special apparatus other than necessary terminal simulators. The procedures do not cover the associated antenna and transmission lines.<<ETX>>
