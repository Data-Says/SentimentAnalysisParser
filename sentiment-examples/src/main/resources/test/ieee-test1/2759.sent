Describes methods of measuring the significant amplitude levels of a monochrome or color television signal, either composite or noncomposite. The author discusses measurements at points in transmission systems where the signals are at video frequency. The methods described in this Standard are limited to those involving the use of oscilloscopes, and are primarily directed to specifying means of measuring television signal levels for operating purposes.<<ETX>>
