This part of IEC/IEEE 62582 contains methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation and control systems using the indenter modulus technique in the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements for the selection of samples, the measurement system and measurement conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results. The different parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 are measurement standards, primarily for use in the management of ageing in initial qualification and after installation. Part 1 of IEC/IEEE 62582 includes requirements for the application of the other parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 and some elements which are common to all methods. Information on the role of condition monitoring in the qualification of equipment important to safety is found in IEEE Std 323. This standard is intended for application to nonenergised equipment.
