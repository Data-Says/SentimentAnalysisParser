This standard provides qualification test procedures for type testing cable penetration fire stops when mounted in rated fire barriers. In the course of construction of all types of buildings, cables in raceways penetrate barriers such as walls, floors, or floor-ceiling assemblies of that building. If these barriers are rated as fire resistive barriers, the penetrations should be as resistant to fire as required of the barriers. Thus, in order to test the penetration and rate it, the penetration should be mounted in a rated wall, floor, or floor ceiling assembly as it would be used in practice and the combination exposed to the same standard fire as used for the wall, floor, or floor-ceiling assembly.
