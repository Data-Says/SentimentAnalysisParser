A discussion of the available standard phase shifters, the general principles of measurement techniques, and the basic measurement precautions is included in this report along with a bibliography of pertinent literature. This is one of a series of such reports planned under a program being carried out by the IEEE. The data in this report have been assembled by a special subcommittee working in the field of microwave phase-shift measurements.
