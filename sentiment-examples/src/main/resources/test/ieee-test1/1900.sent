A methodology for accessing instrumentation embedded within a semiconductor device, without defining the instruments or their features themselves, via the IEEE 1149.1(TM) test access port (TAP) and/or other signals, is described in this standard. The elements of the methodology include a hardware architecture for the on-chip network connecting the instruments to the chip pins, a hardware description language to describe this network, and a software language and protocol for communicating with the instruments via this network.
