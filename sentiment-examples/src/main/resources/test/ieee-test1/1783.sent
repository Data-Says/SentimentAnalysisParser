These surge withstand capability (SWC) tests are design tests intended for protective relays and relay systems, including those incorporating digital processors. The application of SWC tests to equipment other than protective relays and relay systems is the responsibility of those specifying the testing. The oscillatory and fast transient SWC tests are presented as distinct tests. However, it is not intended to prohibit a combined test, provided all requirements of the individual SWC tests are met.<<ETX>>
