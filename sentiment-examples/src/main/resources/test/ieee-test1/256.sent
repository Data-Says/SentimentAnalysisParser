This standard applies to surge protectors for application on multiconductor and coaxial, balanced or unbalanced, data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V rms, or 1200 V dc. These surge protectors are intended to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both.
