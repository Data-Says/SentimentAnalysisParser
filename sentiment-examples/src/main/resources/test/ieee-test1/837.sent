Provides guidance for determining the hottest-spot temperature in distribution and power transformers built in accordance with IEEE Std C57.12.00-2000. Describes the important criteriato be evaluated by any thermal model that can accurately predict the hottest-spot temperature in atransformer. Provides guidance for performing temperature-rise tests with direct measurement ofthe hottest-spot temperatures, and explains the importance of developing an accurate thermal model to properly locate the temperature sensors.
