Common identity-based public-key cryptographic techniques that use pairings, including mathematical primitives for secret value (key) derivation, public-key encryption, and digital signatures, as well as cryptographic schemes based on those primitives are specified in this standard. Also, related cryptographic parameters, public keys and private keys, are specified. The purpose of this standard is to provide a reference for specifications of a variety of techniques from which applications may select.
