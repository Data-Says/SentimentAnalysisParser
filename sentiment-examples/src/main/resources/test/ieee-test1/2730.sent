Most measurements with which radio wave propagation is concerned involve the measurement of field strength. Thus, the determination of power radiated from an antenna depends principally upon the measurement of field strength, especially in the low-frequency and medium-frequency bands. Standard methods for the measurement of this fundamental quantity are outlined.<<ETX>>
