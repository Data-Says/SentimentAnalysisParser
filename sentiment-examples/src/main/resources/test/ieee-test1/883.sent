This guide provides recommendations for in-service inspection, maintenance, and electrical testing of live-line tools. These selected comprehensive recommendations are based on sound engineering principles, engineering safety considerations and decades of testing, and field experience by many utilities. Only the electrical aspects are discussed, namely AC, DC, high-potential test, and Watts-Loss procedures. All electrical values throughout this guide, unless otherwise stated, are 50 Hz-60 Hz RMS values. Equivalent DC values as established by the user may be substituted. Two main areas of this guide are inspection and testing at the job site, and in the shop laboratory. Therefore, procedures are outlined from the very basic areas to the more exacting.<<ETX>>
