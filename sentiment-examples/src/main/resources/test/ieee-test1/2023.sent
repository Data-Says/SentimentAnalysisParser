The purpose of this standard is given as follows: to provide potential purchases and others with a common means for making comparisons between instruments and to provide a uniformity of information among manufacturers. This standard also documents the minimum information that users of electrothermic power meters may need. This standard applies to electrothermic power meters as complete instruments and to their constituent parts: electrothermic elements, electrothermic units, and electrothermic power indicators. Electrothermic power measurement instrumentation is generally used to measure (below 3 W and above 2 MHz) the average power of an electromagnetic wave propagating in a single mode in waveguide or coaxial transmission lines. The power range can be extended by the use of attenuators or directional couplers, or both.<<ETX>>
