The IEEE standard defines a serial highway interface system using byte-organized messages, and configured as a unidirectional loop to which are connected a system controller and up to sixty-two CAMAC crate assemblies in accordance with ANSI/IEEE Std 583-1982, or other controlled devices. The highway transfers data and control information in either bit-serial mode (using one data signal and a bit-clock signal) or byte-serial mode (using eight data signals and a byte-clock signal). Clock rates up to 5 MHz may be used, depending on individual system characteristics.<<ETX>>
