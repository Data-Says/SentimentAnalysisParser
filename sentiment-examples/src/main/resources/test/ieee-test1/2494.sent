A common framework for sensor performance specification terminology, units, conditions and limits is provided. Specifically, the accelerometer, magnetometer, gyrometer/gyroscope, barometer/pressure sensors, hygrometer/humidity sensors, temperature sensors, ambient light sensors, and proximity sensors are discussed.
