Methods are established for testing and measuring the characteristics of surge protectors used in low-voltage data, communications, and signaling circuits with voltages less than or equal to 1000 V RMS or 1200 V DC. The surge protectors are designed to limit voltage surges, current surges, or both. The surge protectors covered are multiple-component series or parallel combinations of linear or nonlinear elements. Tests are included for characterizing standby performance, surge-limiting capabilities, and surge lifetime.<<ETX>>
