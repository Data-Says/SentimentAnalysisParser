Electrical, mechanical, and safety requirements are set forth for liquid-immersed distribution and power transformers, and auto transformers and regulating transformers; single and polyphase, with voltages of 601 V or higher in the highest voltage winding. This standard is a basis for the establishment of performance, limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability, and safety requirements of equipment described; and for assistance in the proper selection of such equipment. The requirements in this standard apply to all liquid-immersed distribution, power, and regulating transformers except the following: instrument transformers, step-voltage and induction voltage regulators, arc furnace transformers, rectifier transformers, specialty transformers, grounding transformers, mobile transformers, and mine transformers.
