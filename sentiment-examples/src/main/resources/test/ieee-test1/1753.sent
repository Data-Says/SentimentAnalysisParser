Electromagnetic performance requirements for replaceable electronic modules (REMs) are specified. This standard is suitable for items that have the following features: removable/replaceable electronic circuit modules that plug into an equipment rack or frame, with electrical interconnections primarily through edge connectors that interface directly with a backplane, and electrical power input derived from the backplane power sources. This standard is based on MIL-STD-461E system/equipment level electromagnetic interference (EMI) controls. The conducted and radiated requirements, limits, and test methods were adapted to provide risk reduction of REM EMI before integration in a system/equipment.
