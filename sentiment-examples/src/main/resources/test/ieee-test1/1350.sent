The recommended practice, under the jurisdiction of the IEEE Industry Applications Society, Petroleum and Chemical Industry Committee, presents minimum requirements for the construction, manufacturing, purchasing, and application of electric submersible pump cable. The configuration of the cable is round, with ethylene-propylene rubber insulation, nitrile jacket, and armor. It establishes requirements for a three-conductor round-type oilwell cable used in supplying three-phase AC electric power to submersible pump motors. Cables meeting the requirements of the recommended practice are rated for voltages not exceeding 3 kV or 5 kV and for ambient temperatures not exceeding 257 degrees F (125 degrees C). Use of cable above rated temperature can cause premature deterioration of the insulation. Voltage ratings are nominal phase-to-phase ratings.<<ETX>>
