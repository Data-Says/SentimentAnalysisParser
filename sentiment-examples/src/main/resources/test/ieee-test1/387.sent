A series of analyses of various problems regarding the interpretation of the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) was carried out by VHDL experts on the VHDL Analysis and Standardization Group, the working group that developed the original IEEE Std 1076-1987. The results of these deliberations are presented in this document. The intent is to give the VHDL community reasonable ways of interpreting the unclear portions of the standard. Each issue report begins with a header section, which supplies basic information about the issue. The remainder of the issue report consists of the sections 'Description of the Problem', 'Proposed Resolution', 'VASG-ISAC Analysis and Rationale', 'VASG-ISAC Interpretation for IEEE Std 1076-1987', and 'VASG-ISAC Recommendation for Future Revisions'.<<ETX>>
