A scalable interface between mass-storage devices and controlling hardware/software is specified in this standard. The interface is optimized for low-latency interconnects, and assumes that the processor/controller and the storage device can often be co-located on the same printed-circuit board. The interface can also be used with longer-distance bus-like interconnects, including (but not limited to) IEEE Std 1394 -1995 Serial Bus and IEEE Std 1596 -1992 Scalable Coherent Interface.
