The purpose of this standard is to provide uniform, minimum acceptable requirements for the performance of reliability analyses for safety-related systems found in nuclear-power generating stations. The methods of this standard may also be applied to other systems including the interactions, if any, between safety-related and nonsafety-related system. The requirements can be applied during the phases of design, fabrication, testing, maintenance, and repair of systems and components in nuclear-power plants. The timing of the analysis depends upon the purpose for which the analysis is performed. This standard applies to the plant owner and other organizations responsible for these activities.<<ETX>>
