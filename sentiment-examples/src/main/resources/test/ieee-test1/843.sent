In this IEEE standard procedures to be used to perform failure investigations of power circuit breakers are recommended. Although the procedure may be used for any circuit breaker, it is mainly focused on high-voltage Ac power circuit breakers used on utility systems. Recommendations are also made for monitoring circuit breaker functions as a means of diagnosing their suitability for service condition.
