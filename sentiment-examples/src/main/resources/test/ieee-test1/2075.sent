The protocol and compatible interconnection of data and multimedia communication equipment via 2.4 GHz and 60 GHz radio transmissions in a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) using low power and multiple modulation formats to support scalable data rates is defined in this standard. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer protocol supports both isochronous and asynchronous data types.
