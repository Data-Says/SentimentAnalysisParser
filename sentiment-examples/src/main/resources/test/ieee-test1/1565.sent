In 1969, IEEE Standard 145 was published as a list of basic terms of antenna theory andpractice. That document treated antenna gain as a fundamental property, with impedance andpolarization as independent properties. The definitions of gain, directivity, impedance, andpolarization were worded to emphasize this independence. Various other significant groups ofterms were also defined, such as the regions of the electromagnetic field of an antenna, the termsrelating to cross section, the tracking antenna techniques, and the idealized radiators.
