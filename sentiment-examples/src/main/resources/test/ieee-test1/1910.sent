Construction, mechanical, electrical, and optical performance, installation guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements, environmental considerations, and accessories for an all-dielectric, nonmetallic, self-supporting fiber optic (ADSS) cable are covered in this standard. The ADSS cable is designed to be located primarily on overhead utility facilities. This standard provides both construction and performance requirements that ensure within the guidelines of the standard that the dielectric capabilities of the cable components and maintenance of optical fiber integrity and optical transmissions are proper. This standard may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. It does not purport to address all of the safety issues associated with its use, and it is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
