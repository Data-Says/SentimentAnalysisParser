This standard applies to the measurement of bulk properties of high-purity germanium as they relate to the fabrication and performance of germanium detectors for gamma-rays and X-rays. Such germanium is monocrystalline and has a net concentration of fewer than 10/sup 11/ electrically active impurity centers per cm/sup 3/, usually on the order of 10/sup 10/ cm/sup -3/.<<ETX>>
