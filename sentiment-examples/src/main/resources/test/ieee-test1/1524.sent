The standard provides criteria for the performance of periodic testing of nuclear power generating station safety systems. The scope of periodic testing consists of functional tests and checks, calibration verification, and time response measurements, as required, to verify that the safety system performs its defined safety function. Post-maintenance and post-modification testing are not covered by this document. This standard amplifies the periodic testing requirements of other nuclear safety-related IEEE standards.
