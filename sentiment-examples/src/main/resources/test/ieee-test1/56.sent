In this paper, technical background and application details to support understanding of IEEE Std 1547-2003 are provided. The guide facilitates the use of IEEE Std 1547-2003 by characterizing various forms of distributed resource (DR) technologies and their associated interconnection issues. It provides background and rationale of the technical requirements of IEEE Std 1547-2003. It also provides tips, techniques, and rules of thumb, and it addresses topics related to DR project implementation to enhance the user's understanding of how IEEE Std 1547-2003 may relate to those topics. This guide is intended for use by engineers, engineering consultants, and knowledgeable individuals in the field of DR. The IEEE 1547 series of standards is cited in the Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, and this guide is one document in the IEEE 1547 series.
