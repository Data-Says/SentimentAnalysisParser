The high level architecture [HLA] has been developed to provide a common architecture for distributed modeling and simulation. The HLA defines an integrated approach that provides a common framework for the interconnection of interacting simulations. This document, the second in a family of three related HLA documents, defines the standard services of and interfaces to the HLA Runtime Infrastructure [RTI]. These services are used by the interacting simulations to achieve a coordinated exchange of information when they participate in a distributed federation. The standards contained in this architecture are interrelated and need to be considered as a product set, when changes are made. They each have value independently.
