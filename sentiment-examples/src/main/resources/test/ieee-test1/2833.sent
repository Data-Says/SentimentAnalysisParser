Multi-channel operation is an extension to the IEEE 802.11 WAVE mode that describes how to support a multi-channel system with the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) and physical layers (PHYs) via a control channel (CCH) and multiple service channels (SCHs). Specifically, the multi-channel operation (channel coordination) provides mechanisms for prioritized access, channel routing and coordination, and data transmission.
