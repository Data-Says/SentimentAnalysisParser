This guide adopts ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007. Since computer-aided software engineering (CASE) adoption is a subject of the broader technology transition problem, this guide addresses the adoption practices appropriate for a wide range of computing organizations. ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 neither dictates nor advocates particular development standards, software processes, design methods, methodologies, techniques, programming languages, or life-cycle paradigms.
