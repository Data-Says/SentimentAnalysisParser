An optional Link Aggregation sublayer for use with CSMA/CD MACs is defined. Link Ag-gregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a Link Aggregation Group, such that a MAC Client can treat the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies the establishment of DTE to DTE logical links, consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating at the same data rate.
