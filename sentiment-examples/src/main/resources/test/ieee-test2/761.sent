Methods are developed to conservatively evaluate the feasibility of supplying additional nonsinusoidal load currents from an existing installed dry-type or liquid-filled transformer, as a portion of the total load. Clarification of the necessary application information is provided to assist in properly specifying a new transformer expected to carry a load, a portion of which is composed of nonsinusoidal load currents. A number of examples illustrating these methods and calculations are presented. Reference annexes make a comparison of the document calculations to calculations found in other industry standards and suggested temperature rise methods are detailed for reference purposes.
