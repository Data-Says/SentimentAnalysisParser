The purpose of this guide is: to provide uniform procedures for performing high-direct-voltage acceptance tests and maintenance tests on power cables (including accessories) in the field; to provide guidelines for evaluation of the test results; and to define terms which have a specific meaning in the guide. This guide applies to all types of insulated cable systems rated between 2000 V and 69 kV and intended primarily for the transmission or distribution of power.<<ETX>>
