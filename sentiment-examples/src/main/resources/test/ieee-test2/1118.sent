This standard specifies a serial, backplane, test and maintenance bus (MTM-Bus) that can be used to integrate modules form different teams or vendors into testable and maintainable subsystems. Physical, link, and command layers are specified. Standard interface protocol and commands can be used to provide the basic test and maintenance features needed for a module as well as access to on-module assets (memory, peripherals, etc.) and IEEE Std 1149.1 boundary-scan. Standard commands and functions support fault isolation to individual modules and test of backplane interconnect between modules.
