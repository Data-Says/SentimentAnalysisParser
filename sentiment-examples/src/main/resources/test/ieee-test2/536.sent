Since 1999, test methods for freezing conditions, including ice and snow, have been refined by the IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society and IEEE Power and Energy Society Task Forces on insulator icing. In this guide, the discussion is consolidated, and specific, appropriate, and reproducible test methods for selecting adequate insulators are recommended. Test methods for substation and line insulators at distribution and transmission voltage levels are included in the scope. Special measures to reproduce the environmental and insulator parameters that influence the risk of flashover in freezing conditions are detailed in the test methods. Statistical methods are also recommended to assist in the insulator selection process.
