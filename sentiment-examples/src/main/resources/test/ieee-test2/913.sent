This report covers the voltage-endurance testing of form-wound bars and coils for use in large rotating machines. Such testing is defined for machines with a nominal voltage between 6900 and 26000 V. These tests are to be applied to 50 or 60 Hz and may be done at either room temperature or elevated temperature. The specimen to be tested should be representative of the bars or coils used in the machine and should include all the insulated bar and external gradient construction that the machine winding would have. Special features different than those used in the machine should not be added to the test specimen.<<ETX>>
