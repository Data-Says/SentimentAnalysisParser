The recommended practices and procedures for direct voltage acceptance and maintenance testing of shielded, laminated dielectric insulated power cable systems rated 5 kV and above are presented in this guide. It applies to all types of laminated power cable systems such as paper insulated, lead covered, pipe-type, and pressurized cables that are intended for the transmission or distribution of electric power. The tabulated test levels assume that the cable systems have an effectively grounded neutral system or a grounded metallic shield.
