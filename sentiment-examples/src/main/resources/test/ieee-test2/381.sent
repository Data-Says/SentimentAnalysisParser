General types of load tap changer (LTC) mechanisms, breathing configurations, and electrical designs, described for reference for determining methods of testing and evaluating dissolved gases in mineral-based transformer oils in LTCs, are discussed and recommended in this guide. Measurements of dissolved gas concentrations in the LTC oil are required to implement this guide. This guide is not manufacturer specific, rather category specific. ** Downloads file posted at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/C57/C57.139-2015/
