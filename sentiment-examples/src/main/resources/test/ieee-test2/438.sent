This guide covers general recommendations for loading 65 degrees C rise mineral-oil-immersed overhead and pad-mounted distribution transformers described in American National Standards and rated 500 kVA and less. Recommendations for 55 degrees C rise transformers are included in this guide because a substantial percentage of these transformers are still in service.<<ETX>>
