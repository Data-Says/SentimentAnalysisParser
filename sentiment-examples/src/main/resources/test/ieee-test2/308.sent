The guide for the relay protection of synchronous generators presents a review of the generally accepted forms of protection for the generator and its excitation system. It summarizes the use of relays and devices and serves as a guide for the selection of equipment to obtain adequate protection. The guide is primarily concerned with protection against faults and abnormal operating conditions for large hydraulic, steam, and combustion-turbine generators.<<ETX>>
