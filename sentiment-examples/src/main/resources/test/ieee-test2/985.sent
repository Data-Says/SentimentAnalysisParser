Summary form only given. This standard describes the underlying physics and the operation of floating gate memory arrays, specifically, UV erasable EPROM, byte rewritable E/sup 2/PROMs, and block rewritable "flash" EEPROMs. In addition, reliability hazards are covered with focus on retention, endurance and disturb. There are also clauses on the issues of testing floating gate arrays and their hardness to ionizing radiation.
