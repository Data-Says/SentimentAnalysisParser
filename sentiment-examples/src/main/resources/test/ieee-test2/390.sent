The purpose of this standard is to provide design guidance for the location of fences with respect to live parts within an electric-supply station. The intent of the fence safety clearance is to provide a reasonable safety clearance zone so that someone inserting an object through the electric-supply station fence should not contact live parts or come close enough to the live parts to violate the required live part to ground clearance and cause a flashover to occur. The safety clearance zone is necessary to minimize a possible hazard to anyone on the outside of an electric-supply station fence.<<ETX>>
