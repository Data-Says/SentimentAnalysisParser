Wideband measurement of the apparent charge of partial discharges (PDs) that may occur in liquid-filled power transformers and shunt reactors excited by ac test voltages between 40 Hz and 400 Hz are discussed. The major components of the PD measuring circuit including the calibrator are specified in compliance with IEC 60270. The PD test procedure is described and recommendations for the evaluation of PD test results are presented.
