An aid to users to determine (1) the allowable continuous current class (ACCC), (2) the continuous load current capabilities of air switches under various conditions of ambient temperature, and (3) the emergency load current capabilities of air switches under various conditions of ambient temperature, is provided. This guide does not apply to switches used in enclosures covered by IEEE Std C37.20.2-1993, IEEE Std C37.20.3-1996, IEEE Std C37.23-1987, IEEE Std C37.71-1984, and ANSI C37.72-1987.
