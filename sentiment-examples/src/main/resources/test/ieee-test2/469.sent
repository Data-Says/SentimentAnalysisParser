This guide provides techniques for designers and facility operators to apply in determining the arc flash hazard distance and the incident energy to which employees could be exposed during their work on or near electrical equipment. Included are 2 Arc Flash Hazard Calculators and 3 Test Data files. Contact stds-help@ieee.org for these additional files.
