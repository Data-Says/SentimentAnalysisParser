The guide is intended for the protection engineer to assist in applying relays for the protection of generating plant equipment from damage caused by operation at abnormal frequencies including overexcitation. Emphasis is placed on the protection of the major generating station components at steam generating stations, nuclear stations and combustion-turbine installations. Consideration is also given to the effect of abnormal frequency operation on associated plant auxiliaries. Details are also given regarding hazards caused by operating equipment at such frequencies.<<ETX>>
