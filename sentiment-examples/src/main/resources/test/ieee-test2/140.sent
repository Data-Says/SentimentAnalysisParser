In this IEEE Standard required procedures for performing design tests for high-voltage distribution-class and power-class fuses, as well as for fuse disconnecting switches and enclosed single-pole air switches are specified. These design tests as appropriate to a particular device, include the following test types-dielectric, interrupting, load-break, making-current, radio-influence, short-time current, temperature-rise, time-current, mechanical, and liquid-tightness<<ETX>>
