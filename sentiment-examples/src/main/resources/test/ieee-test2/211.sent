The purpose of this procedure is to define uniform acceptable methods for making tests to determine the performance of alternating-current, aircraft type, induction electric motors. The methods in this publication are intended to serve as a standard for both manufacturers and users of aircraft motors. It is intended that the standardizing of test procedures will lead to coincident test data regardless of which party conducts the test. The procedure is applicable to aircraft motors which operate from constant-frequency (nominally 400-cycle-per-second) constant-voltage (nominally 115 volt line to neutral, 3-phase four-wire or 115 volt single-phase) alternating-current aircraft power systems.<<ETX>>
