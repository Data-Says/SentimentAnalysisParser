A C programming language binding for the Application Program Interface (API) to directory services in IEEE Std 1224.2-1993 is defined. `This standard is intended for use by application developers, system implementors, test method writers, and users to support application portability at the source-code level. The interface is designed for operational, rather than for management, interactions with a directory such as knowledge management or schema management. Security features are not generally visible in the interface in order to permit flexibility in security policies.
