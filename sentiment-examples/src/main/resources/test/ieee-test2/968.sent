This specification defines the requirements for a single-degree-of-freedom spring-restrained rate gyro for [aircraft, missile, spacecraft,______] applications. The rate gyro shall be capable of providing [(dc, ac) voltage outputs proportional to angular rate inputs up to______ degrees per second, a switch closure(s) at angular rates (exceeding,less than)______ (+,&#8722;,)______ degrees per second]. An errata is available at http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/errata/292-1969.pdf
