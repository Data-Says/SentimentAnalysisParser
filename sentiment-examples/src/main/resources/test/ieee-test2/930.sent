The evaluation and selection of CASE tools supporting software engineering processes, including project management processes, predevelopment processes, development processes, postdevelopment processes, and integral processes, are addressed. The evaluation and selection processes recommended are based upon the perspective of a CASE tool user. Therefore, the evaluation and selection criteria address only program characteristics visible to the user, such as program inputs and outputs, program function, user interfaces, and documented external program interfaces.<<ETX>>
