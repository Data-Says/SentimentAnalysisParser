This IEEE guide includes criteria, definitions, and test procedures for evaluating the dynamic performance of excitation control systems as applied by electric utilities. Primary purposes are to provide a basis for evaluating closed-loop performance of excitation control systems for both large and small signal disturbances; confirming the adequacy of mathematical models of excitation systems for use in analytical studies of power systems; and preparing excitation system specifications and additional standards.<<ETX>>
