A method for sizing both vented and valve-regulated lead-acid batteries used in terrestrial photovoltaic (PV) systems is described. Installation, maintenance, safety, testing procedures, and consideration of battery types other than lead-acid are beyond the scope of this document. Recommended practices for the remainder of the electrical systems associated with PV installations are also beyond the scope of this document.
