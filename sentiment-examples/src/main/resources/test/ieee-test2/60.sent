Guidance for synchronization, calibration, testing, and installation of phasor measurement units (PMUs) applied in power systems is provided. The following are addressed in this guide: (a) Considerations for the installation of PMU devices based on application requirements and typical substation electrical bus configurations; (b) Techniques focusing on the overall accuracy and availability of the time synchronization system; (c) Test and calibration procedures for PMUs for laboratory and field applications; (d) Communications testing for connecting PMUs to other devices including Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs).
