IEEE Std 1462-1998 is an adoption of international standard ISO/IEC 14102:1995. The international standard deals with the evaluation and selection of computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, covering a partial or full portion of the software engineering life cycle. The adoption of the international standard by IEEE includes an implementation note, which explains terminology differences, identifies related IEEE standards, and provides interpretation of the international standard.
