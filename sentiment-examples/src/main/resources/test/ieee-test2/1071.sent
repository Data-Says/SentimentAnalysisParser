Protocols are provided for measurement and control networks for home and residential quarters so that they can achieve green, smarter functions. The interactive data format between devices and systems-as well as the standardized definitions of the sensor, actuator, and equipment, together with the data communication processes-are specified. The data format definition for configuration and management-oriented functions; the data format definition for deployment and control-oriented functions; and the method definition for conformance tests and interoperability tests are also included.
