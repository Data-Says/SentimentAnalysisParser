The purpose of this IEEE guide is to alert electric utilities, manufacturers of dispersed storage and generation (DSG) equipment, consultants, contractors and DSG owners and operators to the engineering concerns inherent in operating dispersed generators in parallel with utility systems; to describe proper interface construction techniques and operating procedures for those generators; to emphasise safety aspects involved; and to call attention to possible DSG impact on utility customers.<<ETX>>
