Looking at the problem from an overall standpoint, the grounding of the system would in most cases be done by making a metallic connection direct or through an impedance between transformer or generator neutrals and the building grounding system which is described in Chapter II. The grounding system described in Chapter II in turn is connected to earth through the system of ground rods and water pipes described in Chapter IV.The protective systems discussed for static and lightning protection in Chapter III would likewise be connected to the ground rods and water pipe system as outlined in Chapter IV.
