The object of this recommended practice is to provide uniform test procedures and estimation techniques to determine the relative effectiveness of room-size high-performance shielding enclosures. Specifically, uniform practices are designated to determine the effectiveness of an enclosure in the usual shape of a rectangular parallelepiped with edge dimensions ranging from 1.5 to 15 meters. Test procedures are formulated to enable use of commercially available equipment for conducting tests under nonideal conditions, such as within typical facilities used to house the shielding enclosure.<<ETX>>
