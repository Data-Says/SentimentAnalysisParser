This standard establishes a common framework for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans. It defines a set of processes and associated terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. This standard is identical with ISO/IEC 15288:2002 but contains an additional informative annex, Annex E, explaining the relationship of this standard to other IEEE standards
