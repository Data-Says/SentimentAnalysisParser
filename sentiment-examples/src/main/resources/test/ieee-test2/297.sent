This standard covers the application guide for transient recovery voltage requirements for ac high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 volts and on a symmetrical current basis. The capability limits of these circuit breaker interrupting devices are determined largely by the transient recovery voltages. The guide for application is not included in other existing circuit breaker standards.
