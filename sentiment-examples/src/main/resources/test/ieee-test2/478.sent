The purpose of this guide is to provide application information to users of carrier equipment as applied on power transmission lines. It is hoped that this guide will be useful to the initial user of power line carriers as well as to the experienced application engineer. Detailed references have been provided in the guide for those who require more information. Material on power line carrier channel characteristics is presented along with discussions on intrabundle conductor systems and insulated shield wire systems. Procedures for the calculation of channel performance are given. Major coupling components considered are line traps, coupling capacitors, line tuners, coaxial cables, hybrids, and filters. Frequency selection practices and future trends are also discussed.<<ETX>>
