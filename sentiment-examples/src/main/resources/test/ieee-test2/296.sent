Procedures and calculations necessary to apply the standard transient recovery voltage (TRV) ratings for AC high-voltage circuit breakers rated above 1000 V and on a symmetrical current basis are covered. The capability limits of these circuit interrupting devices are determined largely by the TRV. TRV ratings are compared with typical TRV duties.<<ETX>>
