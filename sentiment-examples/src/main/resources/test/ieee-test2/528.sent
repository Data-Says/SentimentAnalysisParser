The development of the transistor resulted in semiconductor components being used in both relay and communication equipment. However, it was discovered that these components are sensitive to certain electrical surges. Surge withstand capability (SWC) tests are presented for relays so that the surges can be controlled and damage prevented.<<ETX>>
