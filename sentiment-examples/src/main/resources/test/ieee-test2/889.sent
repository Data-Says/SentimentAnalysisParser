This document presents a number of tests primarily designed for transformers and inductors used in all types of electronic applications, but also applicable to many other types of transformers, except those of large apparent-power rating used in the electric power industry. Many of the tests described are applicable as means of specifying the required testing of transformers for specific applications. Section 3 has been developed to serve as a guide for specifying and rating electronic transformers. Tests described in this recommended practice include tests for electric strength, DC resistance, power losses, balance, equivalent impedances, terminated impedances, and other transformer properties.<<ETX>>
