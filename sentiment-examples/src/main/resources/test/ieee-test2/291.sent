This standard is based on the knowledge and experience of manufacturers, researchers, and end users of nonceramic insulating products that are electrically stressed in outdoor environments. The standard discusses the characteristics of nonceramic materials that are needed for long-term reliability in these applications. The standard makes recommendations for principles of evaluation and tests used in the screening and selection of materials. The judicious use of this standard will significantly improve the probability of success in the applications selected.<<ETX>>
