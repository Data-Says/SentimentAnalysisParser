The following topics were dealt with: IEEE Std 91a-1991 presents graphic symbols for representing logic functions or physical devices capable of carrying out logic functions. It gives descriptions of logic functions, the graphic representation of these functions, and examples of their applications. The symbols are presented in the context of electrical applications, but most may also be applied to nonelectrical systems (for example, pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical). The supplement provides additional internationally approved graphic symbols and makes corrections as needed to IEEE Std 91-1984.<<ETX>>
