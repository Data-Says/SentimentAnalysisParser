IEEE Std 1109-1990, IEEE Guide for the Interconnection of User-Owned Substations to ElectricUtilities, provides a checklist and selected guidance, for persons not normally practicing in this specialized field, of major technical design areas that should be considered when interconnecting user-owned and utility-owned facilities at substations. Only medium- and high-voltage purchased-power interconnections are addressed. This guide does not discuss the considerable implications of interactive power systems design and operation, nor does it present criteria or directions for the design of substations.
