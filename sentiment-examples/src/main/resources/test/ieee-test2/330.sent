The purpose of this guide is to present background information necessary for proper construction of ageing mechanisms and selection of diagnostic procedures when designing tests for functional evaluation of insulation systems for electrical equipment. This guide is primarily intended to aid committees to standardize tests within their scope of responsibilities. It briefly describes aging mechanisms of insulation systems and methods for ascertaining correlation of aging during testing and aging during actual service. Diagnostic techniques for use in functional tests are also listed.<<ETX>>
