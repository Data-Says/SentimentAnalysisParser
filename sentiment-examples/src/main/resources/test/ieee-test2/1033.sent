Design test requirements for all high-voltage enclosed indoor and outdoor and non-enclosed indoor and outdoor air switches rated above 1000 V are specified. This includes requirements for such switches as disconnecting, selector, horn-gap, grounding, interrupter, etc., for manual and power operation, except for distribution-enclosed single-pole air switches and distribution cutouts fitted with disconnecting blades.(Superseded by IEEE Std C37.30.1-2011)
