This standard provides a uniform method for determining the temperature classification of solid cast and resin encapsulated power and distribution transformer insulation systems by testing rather than by chemical composition. This standard covers insulation systems that are intended for use in transformers covered by IEEE C57.12.01-1989 and IEEE C57.12.91-1979 as they apply to solid cast and resin encapsulated transformers whose highest voltages exceed nominal 600 V.<<ETX>>
