A test protocol and the performance criteria to determine the flame propagation tendency of cables in a vertical cable tray are presented. They apply to single insulated and multiconductor cables. The test consists of exposing cable samples to a theoretical 20 kW (70000 Btu/hr) flaming ignition source for a 20 min duration. The test facility, test sample requirements, test procedure, and evaluation of results are covered.<<ETX>>
