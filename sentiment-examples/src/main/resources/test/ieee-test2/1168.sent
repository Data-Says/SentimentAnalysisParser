Spurious radiations from the local oscillator of modern broadcast radio receivers of the superheterodyne type are possible sources of interference with other radio services. In addition, in the case of television broadcast receivers, there may be radiation from sources other than the local oscillator. This standard describes the potential sources of spurious radiation from frequency modulation (FM) and television broadcast receivers and sets up methods of measurement. This standard is not intended to apply to equipment other than FM and television broadcast receivers.<<ETX>>
