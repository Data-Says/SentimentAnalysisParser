This guide provides recommendations for the in-service use, care, maintenance, and electrical testing of conductive clothing, including suits, gloves, socks, and boots, for use on voltages up to 765 kV AC. Testing pertains only to nondestructive electrical tests that can be performed periodically to check if there is any reduction in the conductivity of the clothing. This guide is intended to direct attention to appropriate standards or other documents relating to the care or testing of conductive clothing.<<ETX>>
