This standard on piezoelectricity contains many equations based upon the analysis of vibrations in piezoelectric materials having simple geometrical shapes. Mechanical and electrical dissipation are never introduced into the theoretical treatment, and except for a brief discussion of nonlinear effects, all the results are based on linear piezoelectricity in which the elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric coefficients are treated as constants independent of the magnitude and frequency of applied mechanical stresses and electric fields.<<ETX>>
