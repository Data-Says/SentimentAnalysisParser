The communication protocol described by IEEE Std 1149.1 (Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture)has been adopted by this standard for providing standardized programming access and methodology for programmable integrated circuit devices. Devices that implement this standard shall first be compliant with IEEE Std 1149.1 used for testing purposes. A device, or set of devices implementing this standard may be programmed (written), read back, erased, and verified, singly or concurrently, with a standardized set of resources. Sample implementation and application details (which are not part of this standard) are included for illustrative purposes.
