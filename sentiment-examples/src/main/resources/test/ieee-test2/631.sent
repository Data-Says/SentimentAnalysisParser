In this IEEE standard thermal limit curves for induction machines are defined. A procedure is established for the presentation of these curves, and guidance for the interpretation and use of these curves for machine thermal protection is provided This guide applies to three-phase squirrel cage induction machines. 250 hp (200 kW) and above. It is intended to be used for machines designed for specified load and application conditions. However, it may also be used for smaller, general purpose machines if application and load conditions are specified.
