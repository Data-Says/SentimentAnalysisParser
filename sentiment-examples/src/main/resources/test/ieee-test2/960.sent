Recommendations provide guidance in the implementation of the generic standard IEEE Std 1301-1991, and the connector-related standards, such as IEEE Std 1301.1-1991 and IEEE Std 1301.3-1992. This recommended practice may be applied in all fields of electronics where equipment and installations are required to conform to a metric modular order. The IEEE 1301 metric equipment practices are in accordance with IEC 917 (1988) and IEC 917-0 (1989), including cabinet, rack, subracks, printed boards, and common connector-dependent dimensions for connector pitches of 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 mm.<<ETX>>
