The effects of routing, structure type, insulation, shielding, and grounding on transmission lines are discussed. The way these transmission-line choices will improve or degrade lightning performance is also provided. An additional section discusses several special methods that may be used to improve lightning performance. Finally, a listing and description of the FLASH program is presented.
