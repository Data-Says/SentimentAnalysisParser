The application guide applies to surge-protective devices used in systems with voltages of 1000 V RMS and 1200 V DC or less. These protective devices are designed to limit voltage surges on balanced or unbalanced communication circuits and on DC to 420 Hz power circuits. With the guide the reader will be able to evaluate the various types of gas tube arresters in terms of his own particular applications. The guide will consider the sources and nature of transients, the characteristics of gas tube surge arresters, and the concepts necessary to choose the appropriate product.<<ETX>>
