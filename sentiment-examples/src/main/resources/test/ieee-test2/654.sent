With the increasing interest and concern regarding the vibration of overhead conductors, and the emphasis on the improvement of existing methods and the development of new techniques for controlling the problem, there is a growing requirement for reliable information on the self-damping characteristics of conductors. This parameter is a principal factor in determining the response of conductors to alternating forces, such as arise from wind flow over conductors. This guideline has been prepared for the purpose of encouraging investigators contemplating making measurements of the inherent damping characteristics of conductors, to adopt the methods outlined. It is anticipated that the resulting information, being in a compatible and consistent form, will provide a reliable basis for studying the vibration and damping of conductors in the future and for the comparison of data of various investigators.<<ETX>>
