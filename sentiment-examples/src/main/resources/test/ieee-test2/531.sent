This guide is intended to provide a basis for synthetic testing of circuit breakers and to establish the criteria for testing to demonstrate the short circuit current rating of circuit breakers. The guide contains typical circuits for use in demonstrating interrupting capabilities, but these circuits are those in general use and they should not exclude the development or introduction of additional circuits.<<ETX>>
