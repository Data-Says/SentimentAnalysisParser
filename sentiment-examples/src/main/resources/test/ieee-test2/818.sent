Rules and regulations by the Federal Communications Commission governing radiation from industrial radio-frequency heating equipment have created a need for information on methods and practices which will minimize or reduce interference. This report contains recommendations of the Committee to Formulate Procedures of Good Engineering Practices in Instances where Interference is Encountered, sponsored by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. It reviews the theoretical aspects of the interference problem and then outlines procedures which should be followed. A list of references is included which, however, is only a very small part of the large amount of published material on this subject. The procedures described may be applied both in construction and as remedial measures where interference exceeds limits specified in FCC rules. It is emphasized, however, that foresight is much superior to hindsight and that attempts to correct mistakes in initial design are nearly always expensive and troublesome.<<ETX>>
