Mechanical, signal electrical, and protocol specifications are given for a modular data bus system, which, while allowing equipment designers a wide choice of solutions, ensure compatibility of all designs that obey the mandatory parts of the specification. This standard applies to systems consisting of modular electronic instrument units that process or transfer data or signals,normally in association with computers or other automatic data processors.
