Possible adverse impacts to an operating overhead transmission line which might occur when operating the line at high temperatures are discussed. Specifically, the transmission lines conductor, connectors, and attached accessories in terms of degradation in mechanical properties due to annealing elastic and in-elastic elongation, and accelerated aging are explored along with limited mitigation recommendations. Additionally, predictor equations for accelerated creep and conductor loss of strength are detailed in annexes with limited example calculations.
