The electrical characteristics of digital interface circuits (drivers, receivers, or transceivers) used to drive a backplane bus, which appears as a transmission line to the interface circuit, are specified in order to ensure proper electrical functioning with respect to timing and noise constraints. The performance requirements of buses using these interface circuits make it necessary to impose constraints beyond those normally encountered in a specification for backplane buses. These constraints are imposed to (1) optimize the system to accommodate the physical behavior of high-speed signals traveling between boards in a transmission line environment; (2) minimize backplane propagation delay and backplane propagation skew between these signals to attain the required performance; and (3) minimize crosstalk to attain the required reliability of information transfer.<<ETX>>
