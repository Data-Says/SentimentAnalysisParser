Optional MAC capabilities are defined to allow direct link connection between two end nodes with provision for both half-duplex and full-duplex operation; burst-mode packet transmission from an end node to a repeater where the end node may send one or more packets each time it is granted permission to transmit; and implementation of the MAC Control sublayer to allow the exchange of control requests between peer MAC entities across the network when in ISO/IEC 8802-3 compatibility mode. Full interoperability is maintained with existing ISO/IEC 8802-12 products.
