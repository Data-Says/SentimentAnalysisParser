The IEEE recommended practice covers distribution suspension type composite insulators made from a core, weathersheds, and metal end fittings that are used in the distribution of electric energy. The recommendation contains several design tests that are unique to composite insulators. Section 8.1 makes reference to tests on the materials used in the construction of the insulators and Section 8.2 contains a test for mechanical load carrying capability under power arc.<<ETX>>
