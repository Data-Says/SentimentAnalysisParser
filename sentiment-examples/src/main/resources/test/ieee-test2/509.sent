The purpose of this guide is as follows: to outline requirements and establish design guidelines for the selection of aluminum sheaths for extra-high, high-, medium-, and low-voltage cables; to establish basic installation parameters for aluminum-sheathed cables; to provide references to industry standards and codes incorporating design and installation requirements of aluminum-sheathed cables; to provide a comprehensive bibliography of literature related to the subject. This guide covers power cables incorporating aluminum sheaths, except those of the SF/sub 6/ rigid-bus type.<<ETX>>
