This specification defines the requirements for a two-degree-of-freedom dynamically tuned gyro to be used as a sensor in a strapdown, gimballed inertial navigation system (attitude reference units) for use in an aircraft, a missile, a spacecraft or similar applications. The characteristics of the external capture electronics are considered where necessary to define gyro performance.<<ETX>>
