The performance, electrical and mechanical interchangeability as well as the safety of the equipment are covered in this IEEE standard. The proper selection of such equipment is established as a basis for use in this standard. Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics are described, and certain safety features of three-phase, 60 Hz, low-voltage 600 V and below network protectors are taken into consideration. They are used for automatically connecting and disconnecting a network transformer from a secondary spot or grid network
