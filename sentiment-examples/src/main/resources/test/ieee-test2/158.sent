Enabling the construction of high-performance, scalable, modular, parallel systems with low system integration cost is discussed. Complementary use of physical connectors and cables, electrical properties, and logical protocols for point-to-point serial scalable interconnects operating at speeds of 10-200 Mb/s and at 1 Gb/s in copper and optic technologies is described.
