Recommended practices for designing, installing, and maintaining electric heat tracing systems are provided. These electric heat tracing systems are applied, both for critical process temperature control and for process temperature control, on mechanical piping systems that carry borated water, caustic soda, and other solutions. Electric heat tracing systems are also applied on water piping systems to prevent them from freezing in cold weather. The recommendations include identification of requirements, heater design considerations, power systems design considerations, temperature control considerations, alarm considerations, finished drawings and documents, installation of materials, startup testing, temperature tests, and maintenance of electric pipe heating systems.
