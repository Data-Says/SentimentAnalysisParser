The standard provides definitions and uniform requirements for review and audit processes. It does not establish the need to conduct specific reviews or audits; that need is defined by local policy. Where specific reviews and audits are required, standard procedures for their execution must be defined. This standard provides such definition for review and audit processes that are applicable to products and processes throughout the software life cycle. Each organization shall specify where and when this standard applies and any intended deviations from this standard.<<ETX>>
