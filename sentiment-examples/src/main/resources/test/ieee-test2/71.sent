Basic factors and general considerations in selecting the class and means of neutral grounding for a particular AC transmission or subtransmission system are covered. An apparatus to be used to achieve the desired grounding is suggested, and methods for specifying the grounding devices are given. Transformer tertiary systems, equipment-neutral grounding, and the effects of series compensation on grounding are discussed.<<ETX>>
