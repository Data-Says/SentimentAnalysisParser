Assemblies of metal-enclosed conductors along with associated interconnections, enclosures and supporting structures are considered. When switches and disconnecting links are included, they should conform to this standard. The standard is concerned with performance characteristics of enclosed, rather than open, conductor assemblies. Losses are also calculated in isolated-phase bus.<<ETX>>
