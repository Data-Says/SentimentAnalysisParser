A high-speed serial bus that integrates well with most IEEE standard 32-bit and 64-bit parallel buses, as well as such nonbus interconnects as the IEEE Std 1596-1992, Scalable Coherent Interface, is specified. It is intended to provide a low-cost interconnect between cards on the same backplane, cards on other backplanes, and external peripherals. This standard follows the IEEE Std 1212-1991, Command and Status Register (CSR) architecture.
