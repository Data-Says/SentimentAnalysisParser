Excitation system models suitable for use in large scale power system stability studies are presented. With these models, most of the excitation systems currently in widespread use on large, system-connected synchronous machines in North America can be represented. They include updates of models published in the IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems in 1981 as well as models for additional control features such as discontinuous excitation controls.<<ETX>>
