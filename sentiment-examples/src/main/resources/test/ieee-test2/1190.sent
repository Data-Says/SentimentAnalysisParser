Recommended rate gyro test procedures derived from those currently in use, including test conditions to be considered, are compiled. In some cases alternate methods for measuring a performance characteristic have been included. This standard is intended to be a guide in the preparation of Section 4 of a specification that follows the format of IEEE Std 292, Specification Format for Single-Degree-of-Freedom Spring-Restrained Rate Gyros.
