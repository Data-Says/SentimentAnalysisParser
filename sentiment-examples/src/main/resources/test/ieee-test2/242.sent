This standard establishes methods for performance testing, calibration, and usage of NaI(Tl) detector systems for the measurement of gamma ray emission rates of radionuclides; the assay for radioactivity; and the determination of gamma ray energies and intensities. It covers both energy calibration and efficiency calibration.
