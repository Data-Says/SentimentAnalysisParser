Guidelines are established for exercise management and feedback in distributed interactive simulation (DIS) exercises. Guidance is provided to sponsors, providers and supporters of DIS-compliant systems and exercises as well as to developers of DIS exercise management and feedback stations. The activities of the organizations involved in a DIS exercise and the top-level processes used to accomplish those activities are addressed. The functional requirements of the exercise management and feedback process are also addressed. This standard is one of a series of standards developed for DIS to assure interoperability between dissimilar simulations for currently installed and future simulations developed by different organizations.
