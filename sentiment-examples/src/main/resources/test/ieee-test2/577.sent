The application of neutral grounding to three-phase electrical utility systems is described in this guide. It is Part 1 of the IEEE C62.92 series of guides for neutral grounding. This guide presents basic considerations of the selection of neutral grounding parameters that will provide for the control of overvoltage and ground-fault current on all parts of three-phase electrical utility systems rated greater than 1000 V.
