A set of standard procedures for determining and verifying the total losses of a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) converter station is recommended. The procedures are applicable to all parts of the converter station and cover standby, partial-load, and full-load losses and methods of calculation and measurement. All line-commutated converter stations used for power exchange in utility systems are covered. Loss determination procedures for synchronous compensators for static VAr compensators are not included.<<ETX>>
