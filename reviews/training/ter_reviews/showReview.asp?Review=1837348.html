			Had an upcoming trip to Orlando and so I began searching for a playmate.  Farrah caught my eye, about a week out, I reached out to her via email introducing myself and providing references.  Within a few hours she responded and after a few more messages we had a date setup.  Farrah communicated well, was on-time, sexy, friendly and provided a fantastic session.  A super sweet laid-back girl who knows what she's doing and is pretty much down for anything.  I couldn't recommend her more.

	<div class="content-layout-area content-layout-area-review-details">
		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    My hotel, in the I-drive area, was very nice, however, it was fairly complicated to actually locate my room on the property.  While on her way I called Farrah and asked her to park and come in through the main lobby and that I'd meet her there.  I told her what to look for and she gave me some details on what she was wearing as well.  I sat outside near the doors and within a minute or two I spotted a super cute twenty-something in jeans and a sweater come walking up.  I was instantly pleased with what I saw.  She was dressed very normal, but sexy, her makeup was done perfectly and she looked fresh and smiling.  The kind of girl I would be immediately attracted to IRL.  I stood up and greeted her as if I'd known her for years.  Without missing a step, we walked through the doors and immediately began chatting as we made the short journey back to my room. <br>
<br>
Once inside, I gave Farrah a nice hug and kiss.  I couldn't get over how super cute she is and I told her just that.  She excused herself to the bathroom and I began to open a bottle of wine for us to enjoy.  Wine poured and ready in glasses, I sat in the hotel desk chair and waited. donation envelope on the dresser.  Farrah emerged in a pink teddy and heels and she came over and sat in my lap as I handed her the glass.  She said the teddy was her Valentines day outfit, which I thought was cute.  We sipped and chatted for a minute more and then began DFK'ing.  She's a good kisser with very nice, kissable lips.  After a few moments of this, we stood up and my jeans and shorts came down.  Farrah looked at me as she slowly dropped to her knees.  I was already rock hard when she grabbed a hold of my cock and slid it deep into her mouth while looking up with those sexy eyes.  She PSE'd my dick for a few minutes getting me close, when I stopped her and suggested we make our way over to the bed.<br>
<br>
She stood up and off came the rest of my clothes while her pink teddy fell to the floor.  I climbed on the bed, laid back and her tongue found my cock again.  Within two seconds, I asked her to bring her pussy over to me and with my cock still deep in her mouth, she swung around, spread her legs wide over top of my chest and backed that sweet pussy right into my mouth.  I grabbed her ass cheeks and dove my tongue into her as far as I could and then went on to licking and sucking her little clit.  I was so hot, I couldn't help but take a little taste of her ass while I was at it.  After a bit, she jumped up, pulled out a cover and slid down on top of me.  I fucked that little hottie every way I knew how.  She rode me CG, we switched to mish, then doggie and back to mish.  Once I couldn't take any more I told her I wanted to cum in her mouth and just like a pro, she slipped me out of her pussy, pulled of the cover, and started sucking my cock like she needed it.  I unloaded into her mouth, hard, and she took every drop without batting an eye.  She came up beside me and laying on my arm and chest and I gave her a big DFK.<br>
<br>
We laid and talked for a while about all sorts of things.  Farrah was super laid back and pretty easy to talk to.  We laughed and joked a bit and she seemed to be really enjoying her time with me.  It was fairly late and we just laid there naked together, cuddling in a really nice way.  After a 15-20 minute recovery, her hand found my guy and she started to wake things up again.<br>
Watching Farrah look up at you while her tongue is licking up and down your cock is amazing.  She knows al the little tricks that make sucking and fucking super hot.  She sucked for a while and then we fucked some more.  I asked her if she brought lube and she asked if I was asking for Greek, I said yes and she said yes.  She got up and prepped for a minute and came back to the bed and climbed on top of me RCG she worked my cock up into her tight little ass. She rode and I got to watch.  After a minute, I pulled it out and she got on her hands and knees and put her ass way up in the air for me.  I slid up behind her and she took my dick and guided it into her ass once again.  Once in I grabbed those sexy hips and buried my guy as deep as I could.  She moaned and took all I had to give her.  After some good ass fucking, I wanted a little more of that sexy pussy, so we switched covers and I went back in doggie and again gave her as much as I could.  She was into it, pushing back and moaning loudly.  My guy was starting to get desensitized from the friction so I asked her to remove the cover and finish me with her hands and mouth.  She happily laid me back and once again went to work.   She worked my cock for a long time and eventually sound a hand stroke that I really liked.  I told her not to stop and she stroked me until she coaxed up another very powerful load from deep inside me.  She made me cum so hard it shot in her eye and all over her face.  She laughed, but had to get up and clean up her face.  We laughed some more and she came back to bed and cuddled with me some more.<br>
<br>
Farrah and I laid in bed for quite some time and we just relaxed.  I think she may have came close to falling asleep in my arms which I thought was really nice.  I told her I didn't want to keep her over our time, but she was happy to stay a little longer which again was really nice.  I felt good that she was that comfortable.  Eventually, we both got up and got dressed.  She slipped the envelope into her purse, never even looking at it and I walked her back to her car.  We hugged and kissed in the parking lot one last time and she was on her way.<br>
<br>
In all, this Farrah provided the best session I've ever had.  She is super cute, friendly, and very sexy.  She's down for pretty much anything and can be a dirty little girl which you know is what us guys want.  On top of that she was 100% unrushed GFE.  It just doesn't get any better than that.
