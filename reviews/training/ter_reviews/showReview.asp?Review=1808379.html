			Been looking at Katty for some time and decided to make the call. Pretty easy screening and somewhat quick. Greeted me at the door pleasantly and she led me to the bedroom. VIPs read on. Non giver her a spin.

		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    I initially thought she was independent, but apparently not. I think she was really cute and pretty. She was really similar to the photos, but I think she was definitely made to look better in some of them body-wise. Her face was a look that made me feel at ease and was a lot prettier than I expected. When she smiles, she has one dimple I think. It was such a turn-on for me. It was a little awkward for me at first because I wasn't too sure how proficient in English she was. She didn't talk as much as I'd like to with her, but she tried and I had a good time having some laughs with her. She hung some of my clothes up, which was nice of her because I just dropped them on the ground. I gave her the fees. She checked. Then she brought me to shower with her and we did the blue toast. My dick was totally happy seeing her when she led me through the door and she helped wash my areas. I don't know how experienced she was, but I guess I'm a little sensitive as she washed my penis. She put soap in my hands. I didn't know what to do and just lathered her as well. She had a cute laugh. Then we dried up and she lead me to the bed. My heart was thumping and I was pretty ready to go. We sat down side by side and she gently placed her hand on my chest, kind of pushing my chest down as she started kissing me. She slowly started kissing down to my lower regions and I was pretty ticklish when she kissed my right lower ab. It almost contracted. Then she went to my dick and started biting around my balls. I wasn't too into that, but I guess it was hard to communicate to her that. I think she was not too experienced giving blows or maybe I was just too sensitive. I felt the teeth and she went to town on it. I couldn't really last very long as she was going too hard too quickly. I didn't mind though but I felt slightly embarrassed, but I think this was standard kgirl procedure based on what I read. It was my first time at an agency. I forgot to mention that. Anyways, I cummed in her mouth, taking everything I had. Then she went to bathroom to spit it out. I asked her if she was ok and I was sorry. She seemed to be fine. Then she cuddled up next to me and started kiss me and stroke me. I reciprocated. After awhile, she grabs my cock and tests to see if I'm ready for some work. I decide to tell her that I wanted some DATY. She seemed ready for it! I was actually pretty inexperienced with giving oral and I asked for a little guidance. She said yes, but I don't know if she understood. I just kissed her inner thighs slowly and I found out that she actually shaved pretty much everything off which was nice.I caressed around her vagina and started teasing her with everything. Honestly, I wasn't sure if i was doing too well, but she was giving some slight moans and I tried to respond accordingly. Her breathing got a little heavier and the view was quite great. I got pretty bored after awhile and wanted to get on with the act. She motioned me to lay next to her and she finally pulled a condom out and placed it on my cock. She then proceeded to mount and she made a loud sound as it went in her. It felt a little odd but she seemed to bouncing happily on it for awhile. then I told her I wanted MS. We got to that and I had to have her guide it in because I suck. I started painting that shit as she gave some small O's. I moved her legs around a little and her pussy tightened, making me go crazy.  I licked her feet. I didn't really have a fetish for that. I just thought why not. I actually really liked her legs. She closed her eyes a bit and I wanted her to look me in the eyes. Her eyes were beautiful. Then I wanted to go doggy and she submitted. Again I needed help from her. I went slowly at first. Then the pace started picking up as I rammed her really hard, mixing up some of the timings that my dick kept falling out. I think I stayed in this position longest as it was really nice to see her back and butt as I kept pounding it. I played with her hair and breathed really heavily on her with some smooches on her back. Then I reached the grand finale and tried my best to go faster without pulling out. I finally came after awhile and plopped on her back. Both of us were breathing heavily as my dick just stayed inside of her. Then I pulled out. She didn't take it off right away, but we had a good laugh and I forgot what happened towards the end. I thinke she took it off and tossed it away. Then we cuddled some more with me giving a kiss on the forehead and me stroking her hair  and body. She asked if I wanted to shower, but I told her to stay a little more. After I was ready we did another blue toast and she cleaned me up really well. I lathered her body again in soap. Then I put on my clothes. She also asked if I wanted water and she got me some. Then we headed to the door and I got a nice hug with a sweet kiss. Then I was off. i'd like to see her again, but I'll tell her no biting next time.
