			I have seen Devin's reviews before but I wasn't sure if she was what I normally would go after, read her ad though and she says FF so thought it would be worth a try. Texted her and very responsive but cautious about new people which I understand, sent her some references so we could talk a little more freely which she did and made an arrangement to meet. Devin is better than her pics and definitely a naughty MILF that loves everything about what she is doing. Met at a hotel near the mall in Kennesaw, typical two call but had a girl friend come down and let me in the side door when it was time to come up. She stayed outside and didn't enter the room, Devin is trying to keep the traffic down from the lobby entrance. She met me at the door with a warm smile, dressed really sexy and gave me DLFK with that tongue piercing. I have already made plans to see this Gem again, well worth the price and she loves to please.

		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    I had already pre arranged a fetish session, Devin will not discuss specifics in text so I gave her references to make her more comfortable as I want my sessions to be good for both of us. I generally only see Greek providers and Devin lists Fetish Friendly in her ad. She assured me we could do Greek although its been a while we agreed on terms prior to the appointment. She met me with LDFK at the door as I grabbed two handfuls of the perky bubble butt and squeezed, she moaned as we were lip locked. Devin has really big tits as I moved from ass cheeks to those big huge fun bags. Devin loves to kiss and has lots of tongue action, very excellent kissing as my big head is thinking about the oral assault on my cock that's about to happen. We chatted a bit and I asked about using my own condoms, she checked for no latex, she has latex issues, mine weren't and she showed me hers all Poly and top shelf. Devin is a MILF, a very dirty MILF with signs of CB but nothing that distracted me from the rest of her from head to toe kept me hard even before she laid a hand on me. She helped strip me down which I find very sexy as she sat on the bed and began putting my semi hard cock BBBJ in her mouth. Devin really has fantastic skills with her hands, mouth, and tongue. Lots of ball play and ball sucking, using her hands with slow twisting motion, flicking my cock head with her tongue stud, tons of eye contact looking up as she made slurping sounds and took my cock deep in her throat only to slowly withdraw it circling the head of cock with her tongue. She was getting me ready to pop so I had to have her stop and put on the cover, I always ask the girls to do it, seems really sexy to me which she did, applying lube before and after putting it on. She got up on all fours on the bed while I still stood on the floor, Devin has a really nice pussy. Not super tight but she can contract it anytime she wants and make it grip like a vice and then release which I prefer if I don't want to pop too soon. I was starring at her rosebud the whole time while fucking her and lubed it a little, put a finger in it, tight like ass virgin tight. She kind of winced a little and said its been a while, I asked how long is a little while? She replied years, but its ok she really likes it just no one really asks for it. I withdrew my finger and cock from her holes and got on the bed as I wanted her to ride me with those huge tits in my face. None to disappoint as she climbed on and guided me in her really wet pussy, she got a rhythm going and was grinding her clit on my pubic bone as she rocked on my cock. She likes the contact and well it felt good as she would convulse with pleasure her pussy would tighten up around my cock, felt fantastic as she was milking my cock every time she moaned. This was getting to be too much and wanted to look at that papow ass so she spun around and rode me RCG. Dam this girl can move. I was watching that fantastic ass shake as she was making circular and figure 8 motions alternating on my cock as she was riding the full length of my shaft, never once letting it pop out of her. If it wasn't for the fact I wanted in her ass I would have been in heaven blowing my load right then and there. I had have her stop and asked her to get back on all fours while I stood again so I could get in the right position to fuck that re virginized ass. I lubed her up from behind and put my cockhead right at her little opening, I pushed forward and as it started to relent her head went down and she clenched the sheets with a death grip, I heard a muffled "easy". At this point I didn't want to hurt her so I said I'll stay still and you back up on it at your comfort level, she nodded and let the sheets go a little and started rocking on my cock. It took a few minutes of this as she slowly worked my more than average cock in her asshole. As it went deeper she would gasp a little and grip the sheets but she seemed to enjoy this pleasure/pain. I kept going a little deeper and deeper as time went by about half of my fat prick was in her ass and god is it fucking tight, I could feel myself starting to boil in my nuts and asked her if it was ok if I rubbed my cock on her ass and blow on her starfish. She said yes as I pulled out and off with the cover I starting slapping her ass crack and asshole with my cock and it was slewing spunk all over her back, and ass crack. Shit did it feel good, I worked her ass over good and think she needs some more ass fucking which I'm quite willing to oblige. <br>
<br>
Devin has a rocking body, mad skills, more than accommodating services, extremely friendly and loves to talk if you like that. Fantastic hygiene and personality of a girl next door, I will be seeing this Gem over and over again.
