			Beauty is always in the eye of the beholder, but I think you might need to be blind to not think Ariana Marie is beautiful. Ever since I first laid eyes on her, I have been crushing hard and no one was happier than me when she decided to make herself available to her fans. I reached out with an introductory email and after being cleared by Ariana and her assistant (who is a delight to work with - she's super easy going and very responsive to email), we set about finding some time to spend together. We decided on a 2 hour date in LA (she was in town already) so we wouldn't have to rush - best decision ever BTW. Typical call when arrive and get room number setup. I managed to get lost, but quickly found my way to her room with some help from her assistant (damn you multiple towers!). I was ridiculously nervous, and when the door opened, I was absolutely floored by the beautiful woman in front of me.<br>
<br>
I think I'm in trouble here. The bar has been set impossibly high as far as I am concerned. While the number of reviews are low, they are all glowing for a reason - Ariana Marie just might be the embodiment of perfection. She is stunningly gorgeous - seriously, just absolutely breathtaking. And she's even more beautiful in person that she is in her movies, which is pretty damn impressive considering how perfect she looks on camera. But what sets her apart and puts her in a league of legends is the genuineness of her enjoyment of the time you spend together. There isn't an ounce of the "hot girl syndrome" that some girls can have - she is easy going, friendly, and exudes sweetness. She is great at reading people and I think she has an uncanny ability to please whoever she is with. And in doing so, she never makes anything seem forced or contrived - it all just seems to flow. She is beautiful on the outside, but so much moreso inside too. And that smile... Holy crap what a beautiful smile.<br>
<br>
If you want to spend time with a genuinely sweet, warm, interesting woman who just happens to be one of the prettiest people in the world - yes, not just porn, but overall - and to top it all off is an amazing partner in bed, spend some time with Ariana. Spend some time getting to know her and treat her with respect and she'll repay you in spades. Gents, lie, cheat, steal (well, please don't really do those things), but do WHATEVER it takes to spend time with this amazing woman!

		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    Ariana almost immediately put me at ease by responding favorably to a couple of little things I had brought her. Her smile melted my heart completely and immediately. It's not fair how beautiful she is. But as I came to discover, her true beauty comes from within. She was absolutely radiant in this grey dress and striking high heels that accented her perfect figure. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking to Ariana Marie! Rather than immediately rip each others clothes off, we sat down and got to know each other. We talked about our experiences, our lives, the industry, and I really felt like I got to know Ariana. It was a great conversation - I felt like we connected on a lot of levels and are of the same mindset/approach to a lot of things. She exudes authenticity - I never got the sense she was hiding anything or saying what I wanted to hear, but that she was letting herself be herself and genuinely enjoy the time we spent together too. And as someone who strives very hard to please, that made our date a lot more enjoyable on my end too. I never once looked at the clock, but I think our internal clocks both chimed at the hour mark and we both seemed to want to experience each other. I excused myself to the shower and emerged to find Ariana honoring a wardrobe request I had made.<br>
<br>
Now I get that a lot of people want to live out their own porn fantasies and want the "porn-star experience" when they spend time with these performers. But for me, I wanted to spend time with the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on. Our physical time together was much more GFE - and that was because I wanted it that way, and Ariana picked up on that immediately. She's definitely a pleaser. We kissed and gradually let our encounter progress. My towel and her lingerie were quickly discarded. I started quickly kissing my way down her neck and spent quite a bit of time kissing, licking, and sucking on her soft, perfect natural breasts. Her nipples were responsive and hardened as her excitement - and obviously my own - grew. I kissed my way down her perfect body and greedily spread her legs and started to kiss and tease her soft pussy lips. She seemed to enjoy that I didn't dive right in, but that I worked her up a little before starting to lick her perfect (sense a theme here?) pussy. She tasted sweet, and I spent some time making sure to get her nice and wet. I slowly worked a finger inside her tight wet pussy as I licked and flicked her clit. As I said I'm a pleaser, so her moans and encouragements really turned me on further. And when she came on my tongue and finger, I was both supremely proud and supremely hard.<br>
<br>
As she recovered, she quickly made it all about me and started to lick and suck my cock. But she and I were both eager for the main event and before I knew it, the cover was on and she lowered herself onto my throbbing hard cock. I had to start thinking about all sorts of random things to avoid cumming instantly. We worked into a nice rhythm, but I had to keep stopping pretty quickly to avoid cumming too fast. We switched to missionary, which is always my favorite so I can look at my partner and when that partner is as perfect as Ariana, wow. She seemed to love it when I pushed in deep and hard, rocking our bodies together. Finally we switched to doggie. Good lord this girl is perfect from every angle. I reached down to rub at her clit as I thrust into her. It didn't take me too long to reach the point of no return. We had discussed a facial beforehand, so I pulled out and she encouraged me with a twinkle in her eye to cum on her pretty face. I was all too happy to oblige and erupted, my entire body getting weak as I came. <br>
<br>
She smiled that perfect smile at me with my cum on her face - what a sight and I took it in for a moment. Then I went to get her a towel to clean up. Our time was nearly up, but she wanted to take a shower together. Lucky me! We rinsed each other off and shared some more conversation and laughs. I can't stress enough what a sweetheart Ariana is. By the time I got dressed and ready to go we had gone a little over but she never said a word or rushed me out the door. I hated having to go but wanted to be respectful and after a couple more kisses and a great hug, we parted ways.<br>
<br>
Ariana Marie is perfect. There is no other way to say it. Just wow. She is everything you could ever want from a provider and more. I am extremely grateful to have spent time with her, and am probably extremely lucky we don't live in the same city or I would be 100% bankrupt. I will absolutely repeat as able. Thank you Ariana for the most amazing time together! Treat her well gentlemen - as a couple others have already said, she absolutely is the Holy Grail.
