			I have a thing for exotic Hispanic women and when I was in Dallas I just had to meet the beautiful Allegra Hope.   I have been seeing a regular Hispanic woman there over the last few years.  I always see her each and every time I am in Dallas, but she recently relocated to another state so I was in search for someone new in Dallas. <br>
<br>
Now there is no shortage of beautiful women in Texas, but when I discovered Allegra’s profile I just had to meet here. She is hot as they come and has that Hispanic look that I was looking for in a provider.<br>
<br>
I sent her a request and provided my references for her to review and after a quick screening; we were all set for our date. Allegra was fantastic about keeping in touch via email prior to my arrival and I loved our email exchanges before I got to Dallas.<br>
<br>
I was staying in a very nice hotel that required a key card so I had to find a discreet place to meet her.  Allegra is pretty classy so I was not worried about her showing up to my hotel looking out of place.  I decided to meet her on the 2nd floor of my luxury hotel instead of the main lobby or bar area.  This particular hotel was adjacent to a shopping mall so there were plenty of discrete places to meet without being seen by prying eyes.<br>
<br>
Allegra was on time and told me she was on her way up to meet me at the requested location. I saw her coming up the escalator of the hotel and I was extremely pleased with what I was seeing.  I had once again made a smart decision (at least) based upon her appearance.  You know the type?    Long dark black hair, golden brown skin and ample cleavage that will make a man’s heart skip a beat.  Furthermore, after reading her (few) reviews I was not worried about what she would be like behind closed doors.  In fact, I was giddy with anticipation. <br>
<br>
It was pouring down rain on this day and Allegra still looked smoking hot.  She was wearing a cotton stripped sweater, tight jeans and black boots that amplified her beautiful curvy body. Voluptuous in all the right places.<br>
<br>
We hugged each other and took a seat on a nearby sofa upstairs in the hotel and got to know each other a little better.  I enjoyed this time as we talked like we were old friends catching up on a rainy day.  I loved her sexy accent too.  Hubba, Hubba.<br>
<br>
Eventually we were ready to get down to business so we headed up to my room to get better acquainted.  When I opened the door to my hotel room Allegra walks in and I shut the door behind us. I turn around and she gives me a nice wet kiss and it was on from there.<br>

	<div class="content-layout-area content-layout-area-review-details">
		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    Allegra is an amazing kisser and I loved the way her lips met mine. She is also a super sweet lady that I could not wait to see without any clothes on. I relaxed while she went into the bathroom to freshen up and when she came out we wasted no time going at it. <br>
<br>
I sat back in a chair and Allegra helped me remove my clothes and I did the same to her.   Allegra was dressed in sexy matching black panties and bra that displayed her sexy body.  I loved looking at those nice big tits bursting out of that bra and rubbing her soft smooth legs with my hands. Her boobs are MM, but feel soft to the touch and they are very responsive to oral stimuli. I loved grouping and sucking all over those soft melons and they really turned me on.  Allegra was into it and I could tell she was getting worked up when I stuck my hands between her legs.  Since I was fully aroused with my man hood sticking straight up; she knew exactly what to do with it.  <br>
<br>
We moved over to the bed and I pulled out my cock and put it in Allegra’s mouth. I was rock hard as she devoured my shaft deep into her mouth for a BBBJ.  I like POV action and Allegra was amazing sucking my cock; looking up at me with those big brown eyes of hers.  Her BBBJ was way above average and she had great oral skills. I was enjoying this so much that I turned her over and hung her head off the bed to face fuck her upside down.  Allegra loved it and she has a great gag reflex and she can really DT. I was rubbing her pussy at the same time and she was in frenzy as she sucked my cock. <br>
<br>
 I eventually had to repay the favor so I took a turn DATY and she really seemed to enjoy my efforts.  I dove into her sweet pussy; sucking and licking her clit like a man on a mission. I love giving head as much I like receiving it.  My cock was so stiff that I had to fuck her at this point.  Allegra climbed on top of me and gave me a SS to really get my motor running.  I let her rub all over my cock with her pussy and I think she actually orgasamed from doing since she was screaming like crazy.<br>
<br>
We covered up and she climbed on top of me and started riding me.  Her pussy was so wet that no lube was needed.  Allegra was like a lady on a mission as she bounced up and down on my cock.  She knew from my commands that I loved what she was doing.  I eventually turned over and pounded her in K9. I asked her to rub my balls as I slammed in and out of her box; pulling it out at the tip and then slowly guiding it back in deep.  Allegra liked the various pace and tempo of my thrusts because I could feel her body spasm when I hit the right spot.  I wanted to fuck in MISH so I could Kiss her and suck on her tits some more. She was so wet that I was not going to be able to last much longer and I loved the way she screamed in Spanish.  I told her to remove the cover because I wanted more of her mouth on my cock.<br>
<br>
Allegra did as I asked and I stood up on the bed.  She got down on her knees and started sucking my cock with great vigor. She was slurping, sucking and stroking my cock good until I exploded in her mouth.  She took every fucking drop and didn’t miss any of it.  I love a BBBJCIM and she relished in my enthusiasm of this crescendo finish.<br>
<br>
I had booked a multi hour appointment so we had plenty of time for more action.  Allegra got up and got me a hot towel to clean me up. Afterwards we just lied in bed together talking and enjoying each other’s company. It turned out she knew someone who I liked quite a bit, but who was no longer in Dallas.  It’s a small world.  Allegra then asked me if I wanted a FBSM so I accepted.  She had a nice touch as she massaged my body from head to toe.<br>
<br>
Allegra and I kissed and made out in the bed until I was ready to go again.  I had no problem after she started blowing me again.  She really knows how to get me excited too.  I eventually covered up after letting her suck my cock for a while until I was ready to get back inside of her pussy. She rolled on a cover and I fucked her all over again until I couldn’t hold back any more from the sex.   I enjoyed the first orgasm so much that I decided I wanted another CIM finish.  Allegra wasted no time in sucking my cock again.  She had to really work at this one, but she was determined to get me off again.  I let her blow me until I exploded deep in her mouth for cup number two.   She was amazed at the amount of cum that came out of my dick this time around; and so was I to be honest.  We collapsed in each other’s arms after the second round of sex in a sweaty mess.<br>
<br>
After our time was up, Allegra and I took a hot steamy shower together.  This was a nice way to end our evening because it was actually pretty romantic washing each other up in the shower. It’s always my favorite way to end a date.  What’s not to like about lathering a beautiful woman up with soap all over her body?  I wish I could have produced a 3rd cup in the shower because Allegra would have fucked me in the shower, but I had nothing left after the 2nd pop. <br>
<br>
We toweled each other off and got dressed. I walked Allegra out to her car and I thanked her for seeing me and providing one hell of a hot session.  She thanked me back with a goodbye kiss and headed home.<br>
<br>
I got a really nice message from her afterwards thanking me for a wonderful time.   She said she would love to see me again so I have no doubt that I will be repeating in the future.  The next time it will be with one of her equally hot friends.<br>
