			Once again I found myself fawning over a smoking hot lady from Red Tease. When she stopped into town, I had to get my chance. Super easy and smooth arangement, even though we had to resechedule. The RT folks are super nice and accommodating as usual. I'm a regular so the usual call/text system had it all set up. So when the time came, I was texted to go upstairs. As I walked in there was a stunningly gorgeous Latina laying on the bed. She acted delighted to see me, and complimented how good I looked, which I could tell was very genuine. It was an amazing experience beyond any review I've read. She is skilled, fit as an athlete, and as sexy as they come. Absolutely as pictured, 100%. Non-vips, I was blown away by her and the time we had. I highly, highly recommend her.

	<div class="content-layout-area content-layout-area-review-details">
		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    The stories are true about this lady. She is head over heels gorgeous and as fit as her pictures display. Holy crap what a body! 100% perfect in my book. She has a beautiful face, dark brown eyes, long dark brown hair, and a killer smile. She could pass for one of my favorite pornstars, which made this experience even hotter. Like I said she was delighted to see me. There's no bigger turn on than a total hottie acting exasperated by your looks, telling me she was in disbelief! Now, this was all in Spanish. She speaks a couple words in English. I made due as I understand quite a bit, and used some limited Portuguese to fill in the gaps in communication. We even used a mobile phone dictate/translate app which I recommend (on her phone; it helps).<br>
<br>
She whipped off the see through top showing those perfect breasts and danced up against me, giving me a few soft kisses. She then asked me to wash my hands (yup she's a clean freak, which is fine). Then off came my clothes in a slow and sensual manner while she danced up against me some more. She directed me to the bed, wiped my member and boys off with a wet wipe, put some baby oil on her breasts and my package, and then began a delicate but sensual BBBJ. Her body and face is a site to behold. She moved up on top, grinding her hips into me, putting her nipples in my mouth, and exchanging some DFKs. After a few minutes of that I rolled her over, removed her panties and shoes, and began to DATY. She is sweet and delicious. Her clit is very responsive and she began grinding her kitty into my face. She looks so good on her back. I kissed her all over and worked her slowly, and then harder. When I was ready, on went the cover for some sensual mish. She really enjoyed it, wiggling her hips around and grinding into me. The kisses were flying and there was a lot of eye contact as well as sensual vocal encouragement. What a sexy voice! I wasn't completely hard, which was mostly due to the condom. I stopped and jumped back down to DATY with more intensity and some light rimming. She LOVED this and I got rock hard. I spun her around for doggy and oh my goodness does she have an amazing bottom. That site is burned into my mind forever. She pops and grinds and takes a wicked hard pounding, loving every second of it. We switched back to mish on the end of the bed and I put her legs in several positions, which brought her to a huge "O", enough to push me out! I walked her over to the couch for some more doggy and "spider monkey", which got me as hard as possible with a cover. Taking advantage I spun her around for reverse cowgirl. Again, that booty is breathtaking, and she has some serious moves. This was pornstar quality riding at this point. Damn can she move. We switched to cowgirl which was mind blowing, both by action and site. Eventually I picked her up by her legs and she held on to my neck and rode me while standing. I put her back on the bed and continued in mish. She had another "O", and nearly got me there too. <br>
<br>
Now she started to ask me to finish on her breasts, which I wanted to oblidge, and we both watched each other masterbate. Very very hot. There was a brief pause when she thought I was out of time, which was gracefully corrected by her scheduler over the phone. She apologized and threw me back on the bed for another BBBJ. We switched to 69, and then she pulled herself up and began "massaging" my boys and member with her ass. This was so damn hot and got me rock hard. It was also danger close, and she drizzled a generous portion of baby oil over her booty and continued to tease my member with her grinding. I got so hard so fast, so on went the next cover and we went back to hard and fast doggy, then mish, then on the floor for cowgirl. This all lasted quite a while and there were several "O"s. I forgot to mention she rubs the hell out of her kitty in mish and while I DATY. I blew over my time and we realized it, so I worked myself up and unloaded an epic blast on her breasts. We were spent. I probably ruined her energy for her follow on appointment, but oh well.<br>
<br>
She was so hot, so responsive, and the definition of sensual. I can't get over how good she looks and how amazing the time was! She has pornstar level moves and knows how to make it a once in a lifetime experience. I've never been with a hotter woman, inside and out of the hobby. She definitely had a blast too, and begged me to book another appointment. I hope to very soon. This was a legendary romp to say the least. So many positions, so much oil, and a level of eroticism I had never experienced. If you treat her well and can graciously deal with the language barrier, then your world will be rocked. We parted ways with a sincere and mutual thank you, hugs and kisses. Do NOT miss out on her. I will sprint to her again when I get a chance. By the rules I have her scored as a 9, and the language barrier makes that honest, but IMO her service was a 10. GO SEE HER!
