			Was on a trip to NYC and saw Alisa's ad on TER. Was captivated by her looks, reviews and the fact that she offered Nuru massage, which I had never tried but was curious about!  Setting up the appointment was easy and done by email. Sadly, she was in the process of moving apartments and so Incall was not available but she did let me know that she could still do the Nuru massage in my hotel room. All I had to do was get some spare towels to lay on the bed and she would come prepared! I'm usually leary about Outcall to my hotel, as the corridors are crawling with colleagues and I worry that I may find myself in an awkward predicament, if one of them sees her coming into or going out of my room! But the offer was too good to refuse and I decided to go for it.When the day arrived, I was giddy with anticipation! <br>
I had already showered, so as to not waste precious time with her. I had also procured the extra towels! She was a few minutes late, as it was raining and the traffic was bad. No worries! She kept me updated with frequent texts, and built up my expectation! Then there was a soft knock on the door.....  <br>
She looked like a blond version of Audrey Hepburn, in Breakfast at Tiffany's! She is very pretty and looks a lot younger than her pics. Lovely figure. Smallish breasts and a lovely derriere!<br>
At the end of our time, She told me that she really wants me to meet her friend, Melissa Swan, who just left town to visit her family in Russia. She said that Melissa is very beautiful and more experienced and would she love to see me with her! Sadly, she is away till March.<br>
She is an extremely sensual lady, as you will see in my "details" below! <br>
Non-VIPs, she is a MUST SEE!

		    She asked me to get comfortable, while she gets the Nuru gel warmed up. She disrobed completely. Then she had me take off my bathrobe and stroked my penis which was rapidly getting engorged! She complemented my size and girth, and laughingly said that she was not sure she would be able to manage a trip the Isles, (which was something she did offer on her menu). I said no worries, we'll just take it as it comes and go with the flow. Then began the Nuru massage. She poured the gel over my back and legs, climbed astride me and started an amazingly sensual body-to-body slip and slide! I could feel her erect nipples as was gliding up and down my back and legs. When she would reach the top of my body, she would kiss, lick and suck my earlobes and nape of my neck. After a while she had me turn over and laughed as she saw my raging cock, with some pre-cum emerging from it. Without using her hands, she bent over and licked it off my cock. Mmmmmmmm.....! Then she started the sliding up and down my chest, stomach, cock and thighs, mixing it in with some DFK. I reached over and massaged her slippery, gel covered butt, sliding my fingers between her cheeks, to play with her anus and pussy. She murmured appreciatively. My erect cock was trapped between our stomachs as she kept the forwards and backwards sliding movement going. Not wanting to miss out on the main event, I indicated that we should move on! She then cleaned the Nuru off with a warm wet towel and we were off to the races! <br>
She started off by giving me a soft, and deep BBBJ, taking me as deep as she could (I'm on the thick side, so DT was not possible!), licked and sucked my scrotum and taint, while stroking me with her hands. I didn't want to come too quickly, since I was already do turned on by the Nuru massage! I disengaged and switched positions, so that I could go down on her. Moved her to the edge of the bed and slowly kissed my way down her body, before I settled down to her labia. I licked all around her labia and her taint area. All smooth and sweet! I  then started flicking my tongue on her clit increasing the frequency, as I inserted first one and then two fingers into her pussy. She was tight!  Then I inserted my thumb into her anus and after she got used to it, started an in and out motion. Now I had 2 fingers of one hand in her pussy, playing with her G spot, the thumb of the other hand in her anus doing a gentle in-and-out motion, all while licking her clitoris in a rapid fire, up and down motion. Her hips were moving with a life of their own and she was gasping and playing with my hair. My final move was to engulf her clit with my mouth, suck on it while rapidly flicking my tongue on it. That did it! Her hips started thrashing around as her pussy and anus clamped down on my fingers, she came with a thunderous orgasm! <br>
It was time to suit up, so I pulled out the Magnums that I had bought (in case she did not have them). She helped me put it on and I asked her which position she would like to start in. She wanted to try mish, so I climbed aboard and slowly entered her. What a sight it was, seeing my thick cock slowly make its way into her small shaved pussy. I wanted to take it slow, so that she could get used to me. I think it was too slow for her because, she wrapped her legs around me, grabbed my ass and pulled me in deep, all the way the hilt, as her eyes widened and she gave an open mouth gasp. I started moving slowly and she used the back of her heels to push me in deep, at the end of every thrust. At one point, she propped herself up on her elbows, so she could watch my cock going in and out of her and told me that she loved the sight of her pussy being spread like that! Wow! What a firecracker! We built up a steady tempo, and then she started moving me faster. I was concerned that I would come, and I did want to try Greek, given how beautiful her pert ass was. So I pulled out and she moaned in disappointment! I told her that I wanted to try doggie and then move to Greek. She was game! I had positioned a sofa chair in front of the closet mirror, to get a good view. I am a very visual person and that was a sight to behold in the mirror! Her pussy was more used to me now so I could glide in and out in DG quite easily. She pulled out my cock from her pussy and started guiding it into her ass. She was very tight and I was a little too thick, so I could not really enter her :-( ! After many tries, we gave up! She was very apologetic! We changed covers and I resumed DG. Now I was going for the finish. She started furiously stroking her clit, with one hand while the other held on to the back of the chair. She asked me to go hard and fast. I complied and then I felt her pussy tighten in a vice like grip as she wailed and started coming. I really deep thrust into her as I had a huge orgasm!  <br>
Round 2: She starts another pretty deep BBBJ, till I get rock hard again, and then put on the cover and starts CG. After a while, I tell her that I want to go back to DG. She dismounts and moves back to the chair in front of the mirror, assumes the position and tells me to slowly enter, since she wants to watch my cock enter in the mirror! I comply. Then the fun begins!After my usual slow start, I start going faster and faster, working her pussy into a froth. I am nowhere near coming and she is in a frenzied state of coming, every 20 seconds! It's like watching a piston being bathed in whipped juices! She comes repeatedly, her pussy is furiously clamping down on me with every orgasm! After quite a while, I reach an earth shattering orgasm of my own, burying my cock deeeep into her. We both collapse on the bed and she cleans me up again. After a while, she asks me if I have a 3rd round in me! She does not seem to be concerned that we are well over the time allocation. Now I'm on the wrong side of 45 and getting 2 rounds is possible,but 3 would have been a miracle! She is like an Energizer Bunny! AMAZING WOMAN!!
