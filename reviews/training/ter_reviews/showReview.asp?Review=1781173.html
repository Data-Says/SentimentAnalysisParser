			I am always on the look out for sexy hot young blondes, especially European blondes with sexy accents, so when I saw Helena Rozac's ad on Citysource, I knew I had to try to set up a date. Helena is new to the scene and did not have a review when I first noticed her. And while her ad photos were stunning, they were not verified. But every once in awhile, I let my loins get the better of my brain's common sense and engaged in a risky venture. Why not? You can always walk away should the ad be too misleading. I fully understand why some respectable providers, especially those that are novices, students or who have day jobs might want to use models in their photos to represent them. They want their hobby lives to remain separate, just like clients want to be incognito. It's a mutual partnership. But if the real person is not reasonably represented by the model, I have no problem in walking away from the meeting, after leaving a token of appreciation for their effort. It's a risk that the ladies take when using a model in their ads to represent them. With that in mind, I sent an email request off to Helena. She responded quickly and we set the date. Communication is all by email until the day of the date. Her incall is in an upscale apartment complex in West Hollywood with easy covered parking. In fact I had been there a month ago when I had a date with another sexy model type from Europe that I have also reviewed. A few days before the date I noticed that Helena received her first review. She was given an outstanding evaluation by a seasoed hobbyist so that helped me be less anxious about Helena. Anyway, on the day of the date I drove up to her apartment and parked. She texted me the door and elevator codes and when I was on her floor, she texted me her room number. I walked down the maze of corridors and finally reached her room. I knocked and the door slowly opened. I don't know about you, but I find the ritual of the incall instructions, codes, texting and secrecy amusing...like a scene out of an espionage movie .... intrigue...Jason Bourne! Sometimes it's almost comical...I once was in the wrong apartment complex ...and rang the wrong apartment and when the door opened... I was greeted by an old man. I walked away from that one without leaving a token. Any, the door opened and I walked in. Standing behind the door (also part of the amusing hobby ritual) was Helena. Well I knew immediately that I was not going to walk away. My member was correct this time and he was very happy, excited, and standing at attention. While she may not be the girl in the picture ( I never know for sure and if they are cute, I really don't care), Helena, as described by her first reviewer, is DDG. She is very young, has light blonde hair, really nice fit and slender body, very fair smooth silky skin, and a gorgeous face. She was dressed in a tight short black dress revealing ample natural breasts, nice rounded derriere and long slender legs. She is probably 5' 6" to 5'7" and weighs 115, just perfect for me. I prefer thin to slender woman. Her face is very pretty and her warm smile made me feel welcomed. We hugged, lightly kissed, and chatted to get to know each other. I excused myself to freshen up with a shower. I returned in my briefs to find her standing waiting for me. We started out with DFK. She is a very good kisser and she was generous with her kisses throughout our session. My hands were roaming all over her splendid youthful body. Helena is new to the trade and has other activities that keep her busy. Thus she needs to be discrete with her appearance in her ads. She may not be long in the hobby so you may want to take advantage of the opportunity to be with a young gorgeous Euro Blonde with a natural killer body. Just be nice and courteous to this young lady who is starting off in the hobby. Be a gentleman and treat her well, so that others can benefit from her happiness in the hobby.

		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    We stood there kissing for a long time. My hands were roaming down her firm rounded derriere and massaging her cheeks. I lifted her dress and rubbed her through her thin panties as she moaned deeply into my ear. I turned her around so that I could kiss the nape of her neck and whisper into her ears. My hands moved up to caress her full natural breasts that were begging to be released from their lacy bonds. They filled my palms and felt wonderful and responsive. I continued to make love to her with my hands and mouth, kissing her back and moving down to her booty where I kept kissing her and licking her smooth skin. I eventually made it to her honey pot and probed it with my tongue through her now wet panties. I stood up and we moved towards her bed where she then removed her clothes and lay down, giving me a seductive look to join her. We continued to DFK and feel each other, her hand on my hard cock. I made my way down her body kissing her silky soft skin. I stayed at her beautifully shaped natural full C cups and erect nipples for awhile, enjoying their texture and responsiveness, especially her left breast. Finally I reached her lower lips, her golden landing strip guiding me to her wet pleasure zone. DATY was memorable and she really got into it, writhing and moaning to my probing flickering tongue. She climaxed twice and my hands confirming her double release by the hot moisture that collected on the small of her back and the intense grinding on my mouth. She tasted and felt so good. I let her recover than we resumed our DFK. I really enjoyed kissing her and looking on to her pretty youthful face. She really is pretty. Helena then made her way down my body kissing my skin along the way. When I felt her lips on my throbbing penis, I almost came. She really knows how to blow and her oral skills are superb. I let her continue to devour my throbbing member for a few minutes and than asked her to ride me in CG. Helena put a cover on and slowly lowered herself on me. She is very tight. I was surprised by her skill and technique in this position. Definitely in the top 5 with CG in my hobby experience, probably helped by being able to see her beautiful face enjoying the ride, seeing and holding her beautiful breasts, and feeling her light blonde hair fall over my face as she leaned forward to DFK me. She came but continued riding me with vigor. Her movements and the visual of her splendid body hovering over me brought me very close to the edge, so I had her switch to DG. I loved looking at her perfect derriere and enjoyed her approval of this position. We then rolled over to MISH where I could once again look into her blue eyes and DFK her. Our mutual thrusts, DFK, and staring at her beautiful face pushed me over the edge and I came hard. She kept me in her, milking me for a few minutes. When we separated, I went to shower to rinse off the sweat. When I returned, Helena was resting on the bed. She looked so beautiful... a young sexy slender European blonde with perfect breasts and silky skin. What a sight! I lay down beside her to chat about our lives. She is a student, part time model, and exploring the hobby as a way to help her do the things she wants to do in life. After a short recovery, Helena began to stroke me and we started to DFK. I had her sit over my me with her facing the wall. I started to DATY and she responded with deep moaning and grinding. I loved watching her pretty face from below respond to the pleasure of my tongue. After satisfying her again, I wanted her in CG, my favorite position with Helena. She rode me to completion. It was a perfect date with a hot young blonde. I showered and she bid me farewell with some DFK.  As stated, she is a novice, a diamond in the rough, who will over time learn the finer points of being a courtesan. But I can tell you that her skills are at the top of the trade and her beauty makes up for her being a novice. She has a GND personality - well at least an European GND personality. She is just refreshing to be with and I really enjoyed my time with her. I will repeat.
